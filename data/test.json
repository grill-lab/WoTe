Cover them lightly with soil. Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap, so they stay moist. Leave the containers in a sunny window. Twice daily, remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the containers with more water.\\n\\nIt is important to keep your basil seeds warm after you plant them. You might consider using a heat mat or an overhead lamp to keep them warm.\\n', \"Remove the plastic wrap when the sprouts emerge.:  When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil, it's time to remove the plastic wrap. Keep watering the sprouts twice daily, never letting the soil dry out. When the plants become a few inches tall and their leaves mature, it's time to transplant them to a larger container.\\n\\n\", \" Transplant:  the basil plants.\\nTo plant the basil in the garden, dig holes spaced at least 1 foot (0.3\\xa0m) apart. Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems. Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets.\\nIf you want to plant the basil in a container, make sure it's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you're growing; they need to be planted 1 foot (0.3\\xa0m) apart, since they grow quite large.\\n\", 'Keep the soil damp, but not soaked.:  Basil does best in well-drained soil, and should not be subjected to standing water. Water the mature basil plants once a day, in the morning, so the water has time to soak in and evaporate rather than sitting on the plants overnight.\\n\\n', 'Pinch off flower heads.:  When you see flower buds, pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off. Flowers blooming create a hormone change which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves, as well as reducing the amount of foliage that grows. This is called \"bolting\" and is more likely to happen when there\\'s extra sunshine. You\\'ll notice that if you leave the flowers, the plant will become lanky and the leaves won\\'t be as full or tasty.\\n\\n', 'Watch for pests and mold.:  Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles; the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand. If your plants show signs of mold growth, they may not be getting adequate sunlight, or they may be too close together. Weed out the smaller plants to give the larger ones more space.\\n\\n', \"Harvest and prune.: Pinching encourages the plant's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves. This helps the plants grow bushy.\\nDon't pinch on the lower part of the stem, or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy. You want them to get bushy, so pinch from the top.\\n\", 'Enjoy the basil fresh.:  Rinse off the leaves and use the basil to  make pesto or a  Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese.\\n\\n', \"Store the basil in the refrigerator.:  You'll probably have more basil than you could possibly eat fresh, so plan on storing some in the fridge. Wash the leaves, dry them well, and wrap them in paper towels. Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid.\\n\\n\", \"Freeze the basil.:  Freezing the leaves whole doesn't work very well, but if you puree it first or turn it into pesto before freezing, then you can store your basil in the freezer for months. Place the basil in a blender with a little water, lemon juice, and\/or olive oil. Puree it until smooth, then put it in a food storage bag and freeze until you need it.\\n\\n\"], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"four to six weeks before the last frost","question_type":"['complex']","text_question":"Does that mean basil grows best in the spring and summer?","question_id":"diy-2-3","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-7","question":"I collected all the materials.

To grow these stunning plants, plant the bulbs in the early spring with the right soil conditions. Care for them properly with frequent watering and fertilizing to watch them flourish. When it gets cold outside, dig up the bulbs to store them and plant them again next spring. If you live in USDA hardiness zone 8 or above, you can leave your elephant ears in the ground to regrow the next spring.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Plant in the spring when nighttime temperatures are above 50\\xa0\u00b0F (10\\xa0\u00b0C).:  Wait until there\u2019s no chance of frost occurring overnight so the plant won\u2019t get damaged. This is often in April or May.\\nThe ideal daytime temperature will be around 70\\xa0\u00b0F (21\\xa0\u00b0C).\\n', \"Pick an area that receives indirect sunlight.:  Too much sun can burn the leaves of your plant. You\u2019ll want to place your plant somewhere that has partial shade and will keep the soil moist for the plant. Typically, that means 3 to 6 hours of sun exposure per day.\\nIf a plant isn\u2019t getting enough sun, you\u2019ll notice the leaves turning yellow.\\nThe sunnier the spot, the more you'll have to water the plant to prevent the soil from drying out.\\n\", \"Find a spot that is very moist with good drainage.:  Elephant ears are used to tropical climates with high humidity. Plant them in soil that retains a lot of moisture like by a pond or swampy area. Drainage is equally important so that the plant\u2019s roots don\u2019t rot.\\nRecreate tropical conditions in your garden by keeping the soil moist and not letting it dry out.\\nUsing a raised bed or installing a drainage system in your garden can help avoid overwatering.\\nTest the drainage by digging a hole about 1 foot (0.30\\xa0m) deep and filling it with water. If it takes longer than 4 hours to empty, you have poor drainage.\\nDon't oversaturate your soil when you water your elephant ears.\\n\", 'Test for rich soil that has a pH level between 5.5 and 7.:  A pH of 7 is considered neutral. Elephant ear plants prefer organic soil that\u2019s slightly more acidic. \\nTo lower a soil\u2019s pH, add some sulphur, gypsum, or organic compost.\\nTo increase a soil\u2019s pH, sprinkle a little garden lime or limestone into the soil.\\n', \"Place the holes for your bulbs at least 3 feet (0.91\\xa0m) apart.:  Adult elephant ears not only boast large leaves, they can also spread very quickly via runners. Leave enough space when you\u2019re planting to allow the plants to grow freely.\\n\\nChoose a clumping variety of elephant ears if you don\u2019t want them to spread.\\nIf you don't plant them far enough apart, the elephant ears will steal sunlight and water from each other. A larger plant will cover a smaller one, for example, so the leaves of the smaller plant can't get enough light.\\n\", \"Dig a hole so the bulb sits 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1\\xa0cm) below the soil.:  Elephant ears grow best when they\u2019re planted close to the surface. A general rule of thumb is that the hole should be 2 to 4 times larger than the bulb. Use a spade or garden shovel to dig up the soil.\\nThe bulbs will push upwards as they grow so it's important to leave enough space that they won't break through the soil.\\nLarger bulbs will need slightly deeper holes.\\n\", \"Set the bulb in the hole with the flat end facing down.:  It's hard to figure out which end of an elephant ear bulb is which since there are no defined points. The top of the bulb is the end with concentric circles around it. That part should be facing up. Press it firmly into the soil.\\nThe bottom may also have some root hairs leftover from the previous season.\\nIf you can\u2019t tell which end is the bottom, lay the bulb on its side in the hole. The roots will be able to grow down and the greens will grow up naturally.\\n\", 'Cover the bulb completely with soil and water it thoroughly.:  There should be about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1\\xa0cm) of soil over top the bulb. Press the soil down firmly with the palm of your hand, making sure no sections of the bulb are exposed. Water the area so that the soil around the bulb is saturated.\\nElephant ears require a lot of water, especially when they\u2019re first planted.\\n', \"Mark the spot where the bulb is planted.:  It will take a few weeks for the plant to emerge from the soil. Use a stake, stone, or other marker so you don't forget where you planted the elephant ear. Make sure you place your marker next to the bulb, not directly over top of it.\\n\\nThis helps if you\u2019re planting other plants, flowers, or bushes in your garden so you know where everything is growing and don\u2019t accidentally overcrowd them.\\n\", \"Wait 1 to 3 weeks before expecting your first sprout.:  The amount of time it takes for the first shoots to poke through the soil depends on the air and ground temperature. Cooler temperatures may slow the plant\u2019s growth.\\nIf there's still no sprout after 3 weeks, carefully dig up the bulb to inspect it for rot. Cut off any bad spots, then plant it again.\\n\", 'Water the plant in the morning at the roots to keep the soil moist.:  Since elephant ears are tropical plants, they require a lot of moisture. Water the plant as close to the soil as possible underneath the foliage so you avoid getting the leaves wet. It\u2019s best if the plant is dry at night to prevent diseases.\\nNever let the plant dry out between watering. This stresses the plant.\\nDrooping leaves signal that the plant needs more water.\\n', 'Fertilize your plant once a month with a slow-release fertilizer.:  Elephant Ear plants are heavy feeders and flourish in fertile soil. A slow-release fertilizer keeps your plants fed by gradually releasing nutrients in the soil to promote steady, consistent growth. It also requires less maintenance on your part.\\nLook for a fertilizer that\u2019s high in nitrogen. Nitrogen helps the plant produce chlorophyll, which gives the leaves that gorgeous green color.\\nMix compost matter or manure into the soil for extra nutrients.\\n', \"Trim away faded or browning leaves as needed.:  This will encourage new leaves to grow and keep your garden looking lively. Use garden shears to remove the bad leaves as close to the bulb as possible without cutting the bulb.\\n\\nWear gloves when you\u2019re trimming the leaves if you have sensitive skin. Their are certain compounds in the leaves that can irritate your hands.\\nA lot of brown or yellow leaves are a sign the plant is either not getting the right amount of sunlight or isn't getting enough water.\\n\", 'Cut the leaves to 1\u20442\\xa0in (1.3\\xa0cm) when it stops producing new leaves.: 1\\nYellow leaves are another sign the plant is going dormant.\\nYou can discard the leaves or keep them to wrap the bulbs in for storage.\\nBe careful not to cut into or damage the bulb itself.\\nThe best time to cut the leaves is early to mid fall.\\n', 'Dig up the plant when the temperature drops below 45\\xa0\u00b0F (7\\xa0\u00b0C).:  The plant will start having difficulties and likely go dormant when the temperature is below 45\\xa0\u00b0F (7\\xa0\u00b0C) for more than a few days or when the first frost hits. Use a garden shovel to carefully dig up the plant.\\nIf you live in a tropical, warm climate, you may not need to dig up your plant. Treat it like any other perennial and bury it under a layer of mulch at least 3 inches (7.6\\xa0cm) deep.\\n', 'Let the bulbs dry completely for 1 to 2 days.:  Drying out the bulbs minimizes the potential for mold and bacteria to develop. Set the bulbs in a dry, room temperature spot, either inside or outside. Wait until they\u2019re totally dry to the touch.\\nKeep them out of reach of children or pets. If there are any remnants of leaves on the bulbs, they\u2019re poisonous.\\n', \"Place the bulbs in a paper bag with holes for ventilation.:  Never use an airtight container as this traps in moisture and can cause the bulb to rot.

Learning how to choose the right supplies, prepare your tile for painting, and paint and seal your tile correctly will help you re-do your home quickly and inexpensively.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Purchase ceramic, epoxy, enamel, or latex paint.:  Using the right paint is very important. Water-based paint like acrylic, watercolors, or spray paint will not work at all, especially if you\u2019re painting bathroom or kitchen tile. You can use commercial tile or ceramic paint, oil-based paint, colored epoxy, enamel, or latex paint.\\n', \"Choose the best brushes for your project.:  If you are painting an intricate scene or design on your tile, you'll most likely need several different sizes of brushes. If you are painting a large bathroom wall, for example, you can use a larger brush.\\n\", \"Set up your supplies and protect your work area.:  Lay out cleaning supplies, sandpaper, and protective gear. You'll need to take a few precautions to prevent injury or paint spills in your work area.\\nLay a tarp down on the floor to prevent paint from dripping on it.\\nLine the edges of your work area with painter's tape.\\nKeep damp rags nearby in case you need to fix any mistakes.\\nOpen windows or bring a fan into the room for ventilation.\\nWear a painter's mask to avoid inhaling fumes.\\nIf you're working in the kitchen, move food to another area to prevent contamination.\\n\", 'Clean the tile with degreaser and tile cleaner.:  If your tile is brand new, you can just wipe off the surface. Older tile, especially flooring or bathroom tile, will need to be cleaned thoroughly. Start by using a degreaser, then wash the tile with tile cleaner or soap and water. It\u2019s very important that your tile is perfectly clean, so don\u2019t skip this step!\\nUse bleach or hydrogen peroxide to remove any mold.\\nVinegar works well for removing soap scum and shower residue.\\n', \"Sand your tile with 1800-grit paper until it's no longer smooth.:  You won\u2019t need to sand unglazed tile, but any ceramic that has already been glazed will need to be sanded to provide a rough surface for the paint to adhere to. Use 1800-grit sandpaper to smooth the tile and remove uneven gloss.\\n\", 'Wipe off the dust with a damp rag.:  Sanding creates a lot of dust, and it will affect the look of your paint. Make sure all of the dust from sanding is gone by wiping the entire surface with a damp cloth. You can also vacuum away any accumulated dust.\\n', 'Apply an oil-based high adhesion primer to home surfaces.:  Oil primers are efficient at preventing stains and holding on to ceramic and\/or oil-based paint, but you won\u2019t need to use them for decorative art tiles that won\u2019t be walked on or used. If you\u2019re planning to paint in a high-traffic area, like the shower or the hallway floor, use two coats.\\n', \"Wait at least 24 hours for the primer to dry.:  Check the primer's label for a precise drying time. If you're working in an area with a lot of moisture, like the bathroom, you may want to wait 48 hours.\\n\", 'Decide on your colors or design.:  If you are painting existing tile in your home, make sure that the colors you choose complement the rest of your design scheme. It is usually best to choose light colors when painting your tile, as dark or bright colors can overwhelm a room. If you\u2019re painting a design, choose one that will be easy for you to do and will look good in your home.\\n', 'Create a painted design (optional).:  If you want to paint a design, try searching for inspiration in Spanish, Portuguese, or Chinese tile paintings. You could also try a geometric design, like a chevron pattern or checks.\\n\\n', 'Transfer your design to the tile with a pencil.:  If you have an intricate design, draw it on the tile with pencil first. Be sure to press the pencil very lightly so that it is easy to hide with paint and\/or erase if necessary. You can also practice on paper beforehand.\\n', 'Paint your tile.:  If you are painting a design, start with the lightest color first to avoid smudges, and let each color dry before starting a new one. If you\u2019re painting a home surface in a solid color, apply the paint in multiple thin layers. It\u2019s usually necessary to do at least 3 layers, especially if your paint color is lighter than the original color.\\nPainting over the grout is much easier than trying to avoid it, and it isn\u2019t noticeable if you choose a light color.\\n', 'Let the paint dry for at least 24 hours.:  For small art projects, 24 hours will be enough, but for larger home surfaces, wait for at least 48 hours. This is especially important for high-traffic areas like the bathroom or kitchen counter.\\nIf you\u2019ve painted a ceramic bathtub, wait for several days before filling it with warm water.\\n', 'Coat with clear urethane to seal in the paint.:  You can buy urethane from any home supply store.

You can learn what equipment and skills you'll need to get started soldering electronics properly. \\n\\n\", 'steps': ['Use a soldering iron with the appropriate heat control.:  For soldering electrical components into printed circuit boards, the best soldering irons are Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) safe, temperature-controlled, high-power irons. These will let you solder for hours, and are good for complex amateur radio projects. For simple kits, an inexpensive pencil iron will do just fine.\\n\\nUse a fixed power soldering iron, 25-watt for small jobs and 100-watt for larger jobs with heavy cabling.\\nIf possible, variable temperature irons are available, which will make for the safest treatment of the boards. The tip temperature can be controlled to suit the size of the job.\\n', 'Use solder wire of an appropriate alloy.:  The most common solder alloy used in electronics is 60% tin and 40% lead, sometimes termed 60\/40(SN\/Pb); the lowest melting temperature is actually 63\/37. This is recommended if you are new to soldering, though because of the lead content it is somewhat hazardous.  You must use proper ventilation (or a proper respiratory mask), or soldering equipment with a vacuum attachment.\\n\\nSolder that is 60\/40 becomes pliable at 361\\xa0\u00b0F (183\\xa0\u00b0C) but doesn\u2019t melt until it\u2019s 370\\xa0\u00b0F (188\\xa0\u00b0C), which means it may be difficult to work with if you\u2019re a beginner. Instead you can try solder that\u2019s 63\/37 since it melts at 361\\xa0\u00b0F (183\\xa0\u00b0C).\\nVarious lead-free alloys are becoming necessary in recent years under the RoHS regulatory initiative. These require higher soldering temperatures and do not \"wet\" as well as tin-lead alloys.  While they are safer, they are also more confusing. The most common is 96.5% tin to 3.5% silver and will produce a joint with less electrical resistance than a tin-lead alloy. In practice, this is not a reason to use it; the safety issue is the driving factor. You can also get solder that is almost 100% tin, but it is more expensive.\\nBoth lead and lead-free formulations are available online at places like solderdirect.com and in various stores in most localities.\\n', 'Use a flux-cored solder wire for electrical work.:  Make certain the flux used is electrically compatible.\\nThere are several different fluxes commonly available for electrical\/electronic work. In order of popularity, these are RMA, RA, and water-soluble fluxes.\\nAfter soldering, rosins leave a brown, sticky residue which is ideally, non-corrosive and non-conductive. Cleaning can be accomplished with a purpose-formulated rosin removal product, or with isopropyl alcohol.\\nNo-clean flux leaves a clear residue after soldering, which is non-corrosive and non-conductive. This flux is designed to be left on the solder joint and surrounding areas.\\nWater-soluble flux usually has a higher activity that leaves a residue which must be cleaned with water. The residue is corrosive and may also damage the board or components if not cleaned correctly after use.\\n', 'Get the necessary board and components.:  Mostly, electrical soldering deals with \"through-hole\" components, whose leads are inserted into holes in printed circuit boards (PCBs) and soldered to a pad of metal plating (a PCB trace) around the hole. The interior of the hole may be \"plated through\" or not;  in the latter case the inserted lead is the electrical connection between traces on the top and bottom of the PCB.  Soldering the lead on both sides will commonly be necessary in the last case.\\n\\nSoldering other electrical items, such as wires or lugs, has slightly different techniques, but the general principles of operating the solder and iron are the same.  Note however, the lugs and other unsupported soldering points require a firm mechanical connection prior to soldering.  A solder joint does NOT provide mechanical strength or resistance to vibration;  it only provides a very low resistance electrical connection.\\n', \"Get a clamp to hold the components.:  Electrical components are usually quite small, and you'll need tongs, needle-nosed pliers, or tweezers to hold them in place while you operate the soldering iron and negotiate the solder. It can be a balancing act.\\n\\nSome kind of clamp or stand is usually best to hold the board in place while you solder the components.\\n\", 'Prepare the components for soldering.:  Select the correct component by checking its type and value carefully. With resistors, check their \\n', 'Be extremely careful and solder only in an appropriate environment.:  Always solder in a well-ventilated area, using breathing and eye protection. Make sure to safely place the iron (using a fireproof stand or holder) when it is on but not in use. Irons can start fires quite easily by burning into your workbench or paper or plastic. Always use a thermal mat or board to protect the area.\\n\\nLeave 7\u201312 inches (18\u201330\\xa0cm) of space between the electronic components and your face, or solder bits or hot flux may reach your eyes.  Safety spectacles are a very sensible precaution.  Molten solder may splatter, and is essentially unpredictable.\\n', '\"Tin\" the soldering iron tip.:  Melt a small blob of solder on end of the soldering iron. This process is called tinning and it helps to improve heat flow from the iron to the lead and pad, keeping the board safe from prolonged heat.\\nCarefully place the tip (with the blob) onto the interface of the lead and pad. The tip or blob must touch both the lead and the pad.\\nThe tip of the soldering iron should not be touching the nonmetallic area of the PCB, whether fibreglass (very common) or some other material. This area can be damaged by excessive heat.\\n', 'Feed the solder wire onto the interface between the pad and lead.:  Flux from the solder wire is only active very briefly maximum after melting onto the joint.  It is burned off slowly (this is the smoke rising from the joint) and loses its effectiveness as it does so. The component lead and the pad should be heated enough for the solder to melt into the connection point. The molten solder should \"cling\" to the pad and lead together via surface tension. This is commonly referred to as wetting.\\n\\nIf the solder does not melt onto the area, the most likely cause is insufficient heat has been transferred to it, or the surface needs to be cleaned of grease or dirt.  The activity of the flux was not sufficient, and external flux may be necessary.  Careful cleaning of surfaces prior to soldering may be needed.\\nUse care\u2014sandpaper will generally be too harsh and steel wool (though less mechanically harsh) will add tiny bits of conductive metal\u2014probably leading to unintended shorts and electrical misbehavior.\\n', 'Stop feeding new solder when all the surfaces have been wetted.:  When the gaps are filled and the surfaces are wet, you should stop adding more solder. No more than a drop or two of solder should be necessary for most joints, though it will vary slightly for different components. The correct amount of solder is determined by:\\n\\nOn plated-PCBs, you should stop feeding when a solid concave fillet can be seen around the joint.\\nOn non-plated PCBs, you want to stop feeding when the solder forms a flat fillet.\\nToo much solder will form a bulbous joint with a convex shape (ie, blob-like), while too little solder will form an irregular concave joint.  Both are visual indications that the solder joint is defective.\\n', \"Move quickly.:  Unfortunately, it's quite easy to damage a component or the board with too much heat. For the most part, however, you can keep the components and the board safe by moving swiftly. A finger on the board nearby may help to notice too much heat.\\n\\nTry to err on the side of irons that are less powerful than you think you might need. A 30-watt iron will be adequate for most electronic work.  Practice soldering is a very good idea.\\nIf working with a double-sided circuit board check both sides for good solder joints. A good joint will look shiny and cone-shaped. if it looks\\n\", 'Consider using heat sinks to protect sensitive components.:  Some components (diodes, transistors, etc.) are quite susceptible to heat damage and require a small aluminum heat-sink clipped on to their leads on the opposite side of the PCB. Small aluminum heat sinks can be purchased through electronics supply houses. Hemostats (small) can also be used.\\n\\n', 'Learn to recognize when there is enough solder present.:  After a proper application of solder, the solder will be shiny and not dull. Visible indications are the best way to know if your solder joint is good. The solder must melt onto the surface of the electronic components or PCB traces, rather than the tip of the soldering iron. This way, when the solder cools, it forms a close connection to the surface of the metal.\\n\\nThe solder joint should coat the surface of the component evenly, not too much such that it forms a glob, nor too little such that it does not completely coat the surface.\\n', 'Keep the soldering iron clean: .\\nClean the iron in between each component that you solder. Use a damp sponge or bronze (or brass) wool to clean it thoroughly.\\n', 'Let the solder cool completely before moving the components.:  Solder remains soft for a time, and there is little visual indication when the mushy phase ends. This cooling should only a few seconds in most electronic situations;  large components have more mass and are both harder to heat sufficiently to solder them and also take much longer to cool to solidify.\\n\\nIf the components are too hot to handle, use needle nose pliers, or a tool called\\n', \"Practice on junk components.:  It's important to practice on throwaway stuff before you move straight to trying to solder something important. Get some junk components from an old radio or some such to practice on.\\n\\nNobody is perfect, not even the professionals. Don't be ashamed to repeat a bit of soldering work (it's officially called rework in the business). It will save you time in troubleshooting later.\\n\"], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"solder in a well-ventilated area, using breathing and eye protection","question_type":"['complex']","text_question":"What are the biggest dangers I should avoid while soldering?","question_id":"diy-22-4","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"return_next_step"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-23","question":"what type of product I need to refinish wood?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Refinish-Kitchen-Cabinets","data_split":"test","original_answer":"Aside from the tools you'll need paint, polish, polyurethane and\/or putty depending on what you're trying to do.

I've shared the details here.","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Organize Your Closet', 'description': \"\\nHaving an organized closet is the gateway to having an organized room and an organized life. To organize your closet, you'll have to sort through all of your clothes to determine what you really need and find the best way to reorganize your clothes and other belongings. If you want to know how to organize your closet, just follow these steps.\\n\\n\", 'steps': ['Remove all of the clothes from your closet.:  Take all of your clothes off their hangers and out of any bins or drawers in your closet. Fold them in piles on the floor or on your bed. This includes your shoes as well. It may also include other accessories such as belts, scarves, purses, or ties.\\n\\n', 'Decide which clothes you will keep.:  You may have the urge to keep everything, or toss everything. But go through systematically and piece by piece to really scrutinize your clothing. What you want in your closet are clothes that you wear on a regular basis, that fit you and are functional, and fit in the space available.\\n\\nDoes the item fit? Clothing in the closet should fit you properly, neither too loose nor too tight. It typically means it is comfortable, not pinching, clothing can button easily, and no red marks left on the skin. It may also mean letting go of items no longer in fashion, such as skin tight skirts you really should not wear to your professional job.\\nIt is usually best to let go of \"inspirational items\" such as the jeans you hope to someday fit back into; trends being what they are the item may well be out of fashion when you do lose the weight. One pair of \"fat pants\" may be OK to remind you of your weight loss accomplishment.\\nIf your weight is fluctuating up or down (such as in growing young adults, pregnant women, or dieters) this may be tricky. Still, get rid or store items that clearly do not fit you.\\nDo I wear this? Have you worn the item in the last year? How often do you wear it: once a week or only once this year? If you have not worn the item in a long time, that may well indicate it is time to let go.\\nSpecial use items may be OK to keep even if used only periodically. You might have a Christmas sweater, or interview outfit, or formal dress that isn\\'t used often but still worth having available.\\nDo I like this? If you really don\\'t like an item, do not keep it. In general, do not hang onto items out of guilt--such as that shirt your father bought you but you just do not like.\\nDo I have multiples of this? Work or school uniforms are one thing. But if you have seven black almost identical t-shirts, that might be a sign to let go of a few.\\nMake a \"Keep\" pile for the clothes that you will keep and wear on a regular basis.\\n', \"Decide which clothes you will store.:  You should store the clothes that you won't be wearing for a while because they aren't seasonally appropriate. If it's the middle of summer, you can store your winter sweaters and scarves, and if it's the dead of winter, you can store your tank tops and summer dresses.\\n\\nYou can also store clothes that may have sentimental value for you, such as a shirt your grandmother knitted for you, or an old t-shirt from your high school tennis team that no longer fits. Try to keep the sentimental value clothes to a minimum, though. Clothes are meant to be worn, after all.\\nConsider displaying beloved clothing instead of keeping them in your closet. Consider framing your prized concert T-shirt, or creating a shadow box of your Boy Scout uniform and awards, or make a T-shirt quilt of your old marathon shirts.\\nWhen you're done sorting through the clothes you will store, put them in a plastic bin or a clear bag marked keep. You can either store them in the back of your closet, under your bed, or in a storage unit or a different part of your home if you have the room.\\n\", \"Decide which clothes you will donate or throw out.:  This is the hardest step, and the most important. If you want to have a truly organized closet, then your goal should be to get rid of as many items of clothing as possible. This doesn't mean you should throw out your favorite things - however, it does mean that you should take a long hard look to ask yourself which clothes you will actually ever wear again.\\n\\nIf you haven't worn something in over a year and it has no sentimental value, it's time to donate it.\\nIf you have an item that is so worn, covered in moth holes, or faded that you and anyone else will never wear it again, then it's time to throw it out.\\nIf you have a few items of clothing that are just way too small, stop waiting for the day that they will fit and donate them.\\nDonate all of the clothes you don't need that are in good condition, or give them to a sibling or friend.\\n\", 'Clean the inside of the closet.:  You should do this before you put back your clothes. Vacuum or sweep the floor, wipe the walls down with all-purpose cleaner, and sweep away any cobwebs that may have accumulated there.\\n\\nIf you want to make any changes, such as painting the inside a different color or adding and removing some shelves, do it now.\\n', \"Hang up your clothes and organize them.:  Try to hang up as many of your clothes as you can. This will make it easier for you to find your clothes and to conserve space. You should not only hang up your clothes, but you should also organize them in a particular way so you can easily find them whenever you need to. Here are some ways to organize the clothes you hang up:\\nOrganize your clothes by season. If you've stored away some of your seasonal clothes, organize your clothes by season just for half the year. If it's summer, hang up your summer clothes first, followed by your fall clothes.\\nOrganize your clothes by type. You can separate your tank tops, shirts, pants, skirts, and dresses.\\nOrganize your work and casual clothes. Separate your work clothes from your casual clothes so you can easily get dressed for work in the morning.\\nOrganize your clothes by how often you wear them. You can choose any method of organization, but hang up a few key items, like your favorite hoodie or the pair of jeans you wear all the time, in the most accessible place.\\nIf you really want to step it up a notch, you can use differently colored hangers to mark a different type of clothing. For example, you can hang your tops on pink hangers, or your work clothes on green hangers.\\nColour code your clothes. example in rainbow colours\\nYou can also think about installing another pole to hang up your additional clothes.\\n\", \"Put additional clothes in other parts of your closet.:  Once you've hung up all of the clothes fit on your pole, you should find other parts of the closet to store the rest of your clothes. The clothes that you put in the bins should be used less frequently than the clothes you hang up, or they should be clothes that don't need to be hung up, like your workout clothes. Here are a few ideas:\\n\\nDon't waste the space under your hanging clothes. Put a few plastic bins of clothes under the hanging clothing.\\nIf you have room for a dresser, consider putting one in your closet. It will save you time and space.\\nConsider  installing a closet organizer to find a more\\nIf you have overhead space, make the most of it. Use it to store bulky sweaters, sweats, and other items that are thick and easy to spot.\\n\", \"Organize your shoes.:  Your shoes may take up a lot of the space in your closet, so once you've chosen which shoes you will keep, it's important to make the most of your space by storing them in the most organized and efficient manner. Here are some ways to organize the shoes in your closet:\\n\\nOrganize them by type. Separate your dress shoes, sandals, and boots.\\nOrganize them by how often you wear them. Keep your favorite pair of boots, flip-flops, or sneakers in the place with the easiest access.\\nInvest in a shoe rack to place on the floor of your closet. This will make it much easier to find the pair of shoes you want.\\nTry storing your shoes in your overhead space. This is another easy way to save space.\\nIf your closet has a door that opens instead of a sliding door, consider getting a hanging shoe rack.\\nIf you have a front hall closet, consider putting the shoes you wear the most often there instead to save space in your personal closet.\\n\", \"Organize any boxes in your closet.:  If your closet is big enough, then it's likely that you've stored things other than clothes in it, such as big boxes filled with mementos, old photo albums, and CDs you haven't seen for ten years. To finish organizing your closet, you should go through these old boxes to see what you should keep and what you should toss. Here's how to do it:\\n\\nGet rid of any papers or items you've kept for over a year that have no sentimental value.\\nConsolidate the boxes to save closet space. If your closet is already cramped, consider putting some of the items in a different place, such as putting your old high school yearbooks on the bottom of your bookshelf.\\nIf you've been using cardboard boxes, trade them up for plastic bins. They will last longer and will be more visually appealing.\\nLabel the boxes or bins so you know what's in them next time you move or organize your things again.\\n\", \"Organize any additional items in your closet.:  Take the time to go through any additional items in your closet to make sure that you still need them and that the closet is really the best place for them. Here are some examples:\\n\\nIf you find any towels, sheets, or blankets, put them in your linen closet.\\nIf you've had an old lawn chair or another piece of furniture you don't really need hanging out back there, it's time to throw it out.\\nIf you've had to pick up an item and spend at least fifteen seconds trying to figure out what the heck it is or why you would need it, it's time to throw it out.\\nMake sure that all of the other items you find belong in the closet and not another part of your home. For example, if you find a box of light bulbs, a box of comic books, or a box of chocolate, ask yourself if those items wouldn't be more logically organized elsewhere.\\n\", \"Make your closet more visually appealing.:  Turn your creativity loose and think of ways to add pleasure to the routine of getting dressed and looking through your closet every day. If you spend more time making your closet look nice, then you will be less likely to let it get messy in the future.\\n\\nPaint your closet a soft pretty color.\\nAdd mirrors for sparkle.\\nHang jewelry and scarves where you can see them -- as long as they don't get in your way.\\nHang up a small poster or painting that makes you smile every time you open your closet.\\n\", 'Enjoy your newly organized closet.:  Take a step back and admire your hard work! Hopefully, your closet is organized now so that all of its contents are easy to find and its overall appearance is to your liking. If not, take a few more minutes to make any minor changes that still need to be made.\\n\\nFrom this point forward, try to keep your closet organized as you add to it, or remove and return its current contents. Doing so will prevent you from needing to do another large overhaul on your closet in the future.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"organize your clothes by season","question_type":"['confirmation']","text_question":"Should i organise them by colour?","question_id":"diy-24-0","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_external_fact"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-26","question":"I have applied the second coat after waiting, what should I do now?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Paint-Stripes-on-a-Wall","data_split":"test","original_answer":"When the paint is still a little wet, pull off the painter's tape.

","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Paint Stripes on a Wall', 'description': '\\nPainting stripes on your wall is a great way to change up a room without doing expensive remodeling. Stripes look wonderful on an accent wall in a large room, or they can cover all of the walls in a small room, like a bathroom. When you\u2019re deciding where and how to paint stripes, you should pick between horizontal or vertical stripes, and then you can mark the design on the wall with tape and begin painting![1]\\nX\\nExpert Source\\n\\nAndres MatheuCommercial Painter\\nExpert Interview.  28 July 2020.\\n\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Choose between horizontal or vertical stripes.:  Look around your room and decide where you\u2019d like to paint the stripes. If you want the room too look longer or wider, opt for horizontal stripes. To make your ceilings look taller, go for vertical stripes that reach the top of the wall. If there are fixtures on the wall, like lights or windows, remember that they will interrupt the stripes and can lessen the visual effect.\\nDon\u2019t be afraid to get creative when it comes to picking a pattern. You can even do diagonal stripes for an interesting and eye-catching design. You can also go out of the box with a chevron design or stripes of varying widths.\\n', 'Pick 2-3 coordinating colors for the stripes.:  Once you decide on a design, choose a color scheme for the stripes. Opt for monochromatic warm tones, like red, orange, yellow, brown, cream, or tan, for an inviting and cozy space. If you want to make a bolder statement, go for cool, contrasting shades, like blue, purple, black, white, or silver.\\nIf you\u2019re having trouble figuring out your shades, consult a color wheel for assistance, or look at photos of striped walls online for some inspiration.\\n', 'Remove all furniture from the room and lay down a drop cloth.:  If you\u2019re painting the entire room with stripes, move as much furniture as possible out of the room. If you\u2019re only painting one wall, push any furniture that\u2019s on that wall into the middle of the room. Then, lay down drop cloth or plastic to prevent paint drips from staining your floor or carpeting.\\nYou should also remove anything that\u2019s hanging on the walls that you will be painting, like pictures or shelves. This will ensure that you get crisp, clean stripes with no interruptions.\\n', 'Paint the entire wall with 2 coats of your base color.:  Choose the lightest shade in your color scheme for the base, since it will be easier to paint over a lighter hue than a darker one. Use a roller to apply the first coat of paint evenly, and let it dry for 24 hours. Then, apply a second coat with the roller for more coverage.\\nIf the wall is already a color that\u2019s part of your scheme, you don\u2019t have to apply fresh paint.\\n', 'Let the base coat dry for 48 hours before marking and taping.:  After you apply the 2nd coat of paint, let the paint dry completely before you begin the process of adding stripes. This will help to prevent chipping or peeling of the base color when you remove the tape from the stripes.\\nIf the paint isn\u2019t dry when you begin marking and taping, you can smear the paint and ruin your stripes. Be patient!\\n', \"Measure the wall and divide by the number of stripes to find the width of each.:  If all of your stripes are going to be the same width, use a tape measure to find the length or height of the wall. For vertical stripes, measure the length of the wall, and for horizontal stripes, measure the height. Then, divide the measurement by the number of stripes you\u2019d like to have.\\nFor example, if you have a wall that is 144 inches (370\\xa0cm) long and you want to paint 16 vertical stripes, you would divide 144 inches (370\\xa0cm) by 16 to find that each stripe should be 9 inches (23\\xa0cm) wide.\\nIf you're doing chevron stripes, you'll still measure the wall the same way to decide where to start the stripes.\\n\", 'Use a ruler to mark the sides of the stripes on the wall.:  Start at the top left corner of the wall and measure down for horizontal stripes or to the right for vertical stripes, measuring the width of 1 stripe. Mark a small \u201cX\u201d with a pencil, and measure the width of another stripe from that mark, continuing until you\u2019ve marked  and marked the edges of each stripe. Once you finish one side, move to the opposite side of the wall and repeat the process.\\nFor instance, for 16 vertical stripes on a wall that is 144 inches (370\\xa0cm) long, you would mark the edges of each stripe with 9 inches (23\\xa0cm) of space between the marks along the top of the wall. Once you\u2019ve marked all of them, you would do the same along the bottom of the wall.\\nFor chevron stripes, you should also mark the high and low points of each stripe, keeping an equal distance between the top of the strip and the bottom of the stripe.\\n', \"Connect the marks for the edges of the stripes with a level.:  Use a carpenter\u2019s level or a laser level to line up the markings on the top and bottom or left and right side of the wall so they\u2019re perfectly straight. Then, run your pencil along the level lightly to make a straight line, which will be the edge of your stripe.\\nIf you don\u2019t have a level, you can have 2 people hold the ends of a tape measure in place and carefully run your pencil along the tape measure to connect the markings.\\nIf you're painting chevron stripes, hold the level at an angle to connect the dots at the high and low points of each stripe, making a zig-zag pattern.\\n\", 'Lay painter\u2019s tape over the lines and press down firmly on the tape.:  Lay the tape so that it sits just outside of the line that you marked for the stripes, creating stripes that are the correct width. This will ensure that none of the paint gets onto the base color and that all of the stripes are the correct width.\\nIf you\u2019re worried about the paint bleeding, run the edge of a credit card firmly over the tape to press it down onto the wall. This will create a stronger seal.\\nFor chevron stripes, your tape lines should meet at the high and low points of the stripe.\\n', 'Paint around the perimeter of the stripes with a mostly dry paintbrush.:  Dip a medium-sized dry paintbrush into the color that you want your stripe to be, and let the paint drip off of the brush until it\u2019s mostly dry. Then, paint along the tape on the inside of the stripe to make a large rectangle, also known as \u201ccutting in\u201d the shape, which helps to prevent bleeding when you use a roller.\\nYou only need to apply 1 coat of the perimeter paint to prevent bleeding before you use a roller.\\nDon\u2019t be afraid to get some paint on the tape, but be careful not to get it on the areas where you want the base color to show!\\n', 'Use a small roller to apply 2 coats of paint on the stripes for even coverage.:  Dip a small, medium-nap roller into your paint, and roll it out a little on a piece of cardboard or a paint tray. Then, use long, even strokes to apply the paint to the stripe, working on 1 stripe at a time. Once you\u2019ve completed the first coat on all the stripes, let the paint dry for 24 hours and apply a second coat.\\nThe smaller the roller, the more control you have over where the paint goes. Rollers create a smoother, fuller finish than paint brushes.\\n', 'Let the walls dry overnight and peel off the tape.:  After applying the 2nd coat of paint, allow the stripes to dry almost completely. When the paint is still slightly wet, lift one end of the tape, and pull off the tape at a 45-degree angle from the wall. Work smoothly and quickly to avoid pulling off the paint or chipping the base.\\nIf you pull off the tape when the paint is completely dry, you risk chipping or peeling the stripes.\\nIf you do have some chips or peeling, wait until the paint is dry and then use a small paintbrush to touch up the color as much as possible. You may need to re-apply the tape to get a crisp line for your stripes when doing touch-ups.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Drop cloth', 'Pencil', 'Ruler', 'Level', 'Painters tape', 'Paint', 'Paintbrush', 'Small roller', 'Basic paint tray', 'Ladder or stool']}","extracted_answer":"let the walls dry overnight and peel off the tape","question_type":"['navigation']","text_question":"I have applied the second coat after waiting, what should I do now?","question_id":"diy-26-6","intent_question":"request_next_step","intent_answer":"return_list_ingredients_tools"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-32","question":"Am I just making sure the air is fresh or do I really need constant air circulation?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Care-for-Orchids","data_split":"test","original_answer":"Constant air circulation is a good idea, I've enclosed some tips.

In Japan, a tradition has started where people grow ornamental watermelons that are completely square, and you can do this as well with your own backyard watermelons. All you need are a few simple tools and some patience, and you'll have delicious square watermelons of your own in no time.\\n\\n\", 'steps': ['Select the right location.:  Watermelons need a few things to grow properly, including lots of space and plenty of sun. A good location to plant watermelon vines is an open area that gets lots of direct sunlight throughout the day.\\n\\nWatermelon vines can reach 20 feet (6 m) in length.\\n', 'Prepare the soil.:  Watermelons are heavy feeders, so it\u2019s important to amend the soil with lots of nutrients a few weeks before planting.

Use compost specifically if you want to ensure your soil drains well.\\n\\nThe ideal pH for watermelons is between 6 and 6.8.\\n', 'Warm the ground with black plastic or landscaping fabric.:  Watermelon seeds need warm soil to grow, and if you live in cooler or northern climates, you should warm the soil a couple of weeks before planting to ensure it heats up enough. Cover the garden bed with black plastic or landscape fabric, and lay some rocks along the perimeter to keep the plastic from blowing away.\\nYou can either use large sheets of black plastic or landscaping fabric from a gardening store, or you can cut open black garbage bags and use those.\\nLandscaping fabric is a great option if you want to reuse the material. It also allows water to trickle down to the soil below, unlike plastic. You can easily cut slits in the fabric to allow your plants to grow up through it.\\n', 'Pick the right time to plant.:  The soil temperature must reach at least 70 F (21 C) before you can plant watermelon seeds. You should also wait until at least two weeks after the last frost, otherwise the seeds won\u2019t sprout.\\nIf you live in a cooler climate, you can start your seeds indoors and transplant them outside once the soil warms up. Start them about two weeks before the last frost date and plant them two weeks after the last frost date.\\n', 'Create hills in the soil.:  Hills or mounds tend to drain better and warm faster than flat soil, which is ideal for watermelons. Using a rake or shovel, form the soil in the bed into hills that are 1 foot (30 cm) high and 3 feet (91 cm) in diameter. Space the hills 6.5 feet (2 m) apart.\\n', 'Sow the seeds.:  Plant nine watermelon seeds in each hill. Plant the seeds in groups of three. Space the seed groups out evenly around the hill so the clusters are about a foot (30 cm) apart. To sow the seeds, simply press each seed \u00bd inch (1.3 cm) deep into the soil.\\n', 'Add a layer of mulch.:  Mulch is good for watermelons because it keeps the soil warm, retains moisture, and keeps weeds and pests out. Once the seeds have been planted, cover the hills with leaves, straw, black plastic mulch, or black landscaping fabric.\\n\\nIf you live in a cooler climate, black plastic mulch or landscaping fabric will help keep the soil warmest as the watermelon seeds grow.\\n', \"Water each week while the plants grow.:  While watermelon plants are in the initial growing stages, they need plenty of water. Make sure they get 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) per week as the seeds germinate, and as the plants grow, bloom, and fruit.\\nOnce the fruit has formed, you can cut back on watering. Only water the plants during dry spells when there's no rain.\\nMake sure that the plants do get watered once a week, either through rain or irrigation.\\n\", \"Choose a box to grow the watermelon in.:  Growing square watermelons is as easy as placing a young fruit into a square box. As the watermelon grows, it will grow into the box and grow in the shape of a cube. The mold must allow sunlight and air to pass through.

I've included the steps here.","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Clean Your Garbage Disposal', 'description': 'Kitchen garbage disposals are wondrous appliances, helping to clean away unwanted food scraps in a jiffy. Even though they are normally self-cleaning, garbage disposals need a little love and attention from time to time. This keeps them in tip-top condition and prevents odors from forming. This article will provide you with easy step-by-step instructions on how to safely clean your garbage disposal and effectively eliminate odors, while also providing some useful info on garbage disposal maintenance.\\n', 'steps': [\"Physically remove lodged objects.:  If a large object has become lodged in your garbage disposal, you will need to remove it before proceeding with the cleaning process. First, it is important that you turn off the fuse that supplies power to the disposal unit.\\nUse a pliers or tongs to remove the trapped object (you may need to shine a flash light down to see) , being careful to avoid damaging the grinder.\\nAvoid  putting your hands down the garbage disposal if at all possible. If you do need to use your hands though, make sure to double check that the grinder won't turn on first. Be careful, as the blades are somewhat sharp.\\n\", 'Flush with water.:  Simply flushing out the garbage disposal with water will help to remove any loose dirt or grime. Stopper the garbage disposal, add a squirt of dish soap and run the hot water until there is 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2\\xa0cm) sitting in the sink. Pull out the plug and turn on the garbage disposal, allowing the water to flush through.\\nMake sure to use hot water rather than cold, as the hot water will liquefy any oil or grease in the drain, allowing to to be flushed away.\\nFlushing your drain using this method is much more effective than simply running the tap, as it allows the entire garbage disposal to be rinsed out and purged of any built-up debris.\\n', 'Use ice cubes and salt.:  Grinding ice cubes and salt in your garbage disposal is a great way to remove tougher sludge and debris that has attached itself to the grinding elements. Pour two cups of ice into your garbage disposal, followed by one cup of rock salt.\\nTurn on the garbage disposal, run some cold water, and allow the ice and salt to be crushed by the blades.\\nAn alternative to the ice and rock salt combination is to make freeze some white vinegar into ice cubes and crush these in the garbage disposal instead.\\nIn addition to cleaning the garbage disposal, grinding ice will sharpen the blades and remove any unwanted odors.\\n', 'Scrub with an old toothbrush or scrub brush.:  It is also possible to manually clean the inside of your garbage disposal using an old toothbrush or even a scrub brush designed for garbage disposals. If possible, remove the screen from the top of the drain first; this will make it both easier to see and easier to clean.\\n\\n', 'Use citrus fruit peels.:  A great natural way to freshen up your garbage disposal and leave your kitchen smelling great is to grind up a handful of citrus peels. Any citrus fruit will do -- orange, lemon, grapefruit, lime. The citric acid in the peels will clean the blades and eliminate odors.\\nAfterwards, add some spice, rosemary oil, or lavender oil for an even fresher scent.\\n', 'Use baking soda and vinegar.:  Baking soda and vinegar make a great odor-busting combo. Sprinkle half a cup of baking soda into the drain, then gently pour a cup of white vinegar on top. The mixture will fizzle and bubble. Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes, then rinse it down with very hot or boiling water, with the garbage disposal running.\\n', \"Rinse with a little bleach.:  Bleach is very effective at killing germs and will quickly freshen up your drain., however you don't want to use too much of it as it can also harden any grease in your disposal unit, making it difficult to remove.\\nDilute a tablespoon of liquid chlorine bleach in a gallon of water and slowly pour it into your garbage disposal.\\nAllow the bleach to sit there for a minute or two, then turn on the hot water tap and leave it running for several minutes to flush away the bleach.\\n\", 'Use Borax.:  Borax is a safe and natural cleaning product which will effectively clean the garbage disposal and minimize odors. Simply put 3 or 4 tablespoon (44.4 or 59.1\\xa0ml) of Borax into the garbage disposal and allow to sit for about an hour. Then flush away with very hot or boiling water.\\n', 'Only put biodegradable food items in your garbage disposal.:   The number one rule when it comes to garbage disposals is to avoid putting anything down there which is not biodegradable. The garbage disposal is not a trash can, and using to get rid of unsuitable items is a recipe for disaster. You can minimize damage and cut down on cleaning time by only using the garbage disposal for biodegradable food items. Things you should avoid putting down there include:\\n\\nFibrous materials such as onion skins, corn husks, artichokes and celery stalks. These can get tangled in the motor, so compost them instead.\\nStarchy materials like potato peels. The starch may form a thick paste, causing the blades of the garbage disposal to stick.\\nExpandable food such as rice or pasta. These may expand from the water and clog the drains. Coffee grinds can also clog the drains.\\nYou\\n', 'Run your garbage disposal for longer each time you use it.:  A mistake many people make is turning off their garbage disposal as soon as the grinding noises stop. It is better to leave the garbage disposal on (with the water running) for several seconds after the grinding noises subside, as there may still be small particles in the disposal unit which have not yet been cleared away.\\n\\n', 'Avoid getting grease in your drain.:  It is not a good idea to pour any kind of \\n', 'Cut large food items into smaller pieces.:  You can prevent large pieces of food from becoming stuck in your garbage disposal by cutting them into smaller pieces first.

Or, get a small container of hummus and some pre-cut carrot sticks. Not only will you avoid the negative effects of HFCS, you\u2019ll get a boost of vitamins and nutrients.\\n', 'Make your own salad dressing or other condiments.:  Many salad dressings advertise themselves as \u201clow-calorie\u201d or \u201clow fat\u201d and then compensate for the missing flavor by adding in HFCS. Create your own dressing by mixing together some olive oil, pepper, lemon juice, and balsamic vinegar.

Cinnamon, ginger, and even pepper are all good options.\\n', 'Buy higher quality sweets.:  If you have a bit of a sweet tooth, that is okay. Just buy candies and treats made under the highest production standards, even if they are imported. They may be more expensive, but counteract this by allowing yourself only one small piece as an occasional treat.\\n\\n', 'Use fruit as a sweetener.:  Choose your favorite fruits, such as bananas, and incorporate them into foods that normally would contain extra sugars or HFCS. Mix banana slices into your steel-cut oatmeal or into plain, vanilla yogurt. Dates or bananas can also substitute for sugar in many baked recipes.\\nRegular table sugar is another option. However, still try to use any sweeteners, even natural ones, in moderation.\\n', 'Choose honey as a sweetener.:  Buy some raw honey at your local farmer\u2019s market or specialty grocery. Add it into foods 1 teaspoon (5 ml) at a time to sweeten them up. Not only will you get the flavor, you\u2019ll get antioxidants and essential nutrients, like vitamin B6.\\n', 'Pack healthy snacks.:  To keep yourself from reaching for that HFCS-filled candy bar, pack some fruit slices in your bag for the day. Or, get a small container of hummus and some pre-cut carrot sticks. Not only will you avoid the negative effects of HFCS, you\u2019ll get a boost of vitamins and nutrients.\\n', 'Make your own salad dressing or other condiments.:  Many salad dressings advertise themselves as \u201clow-calorie\u201d or \u201clow fat\u201d and then compensate for the missing flavor by adding in HFCS. Create your own dressing by mixing together some olive oil, pepper, lemon juice, and balsamic vinegar. Experiment with recipes for other condiments too, like ketchup, \\nWatch your portion sizes with condiments as well. A single tablespoon of barbecue sauce can cost you upwards of 5 grams (0.18 oz) of sugar or HFCS.\\n', 'Avoid canned or bottled beverages.:  Sports drinks, sodas, and flavored teas or lemonades are usually packed to the brim with HFCS. Be wary when choosing diet or \u201czero\u201d drinks as well, since they often contain artificial sweeteners. If you must get your soda fix, buy drinks from bottlers who\u2019ve chosen to use only natural cane sugar.\\nCheck the\\n', 'Avoid fast food.:  HFCS is hidden throughout many different types of fast food to increase flavor. Aside from the obvious areas, like sweets, you\u2019ll also find HFCS in burgers, chicken patties, and other surprising foods. Eat foods made from natural ingredients at home to control what goes into the final product.\\n', 'Avoid boxed or prepackaged meals.:  It\u2019s good that you are trying to eat at home, but don\u2019t make the mistake of taking the easy route with boxed meals. If HFCS is not in the main part of the meal, such as the pasta in boxed macaroni and cheese, then it is likely in the sauce packet. If you are looking for a meal shortcut without HFCS, buy precooked main dishes, like roasted chicken, from your local deli.\\n', 'Choose 100% juice over juice cocktails.:  With pure juice drinks you\u2019ll get natural sugars, whereas cocktails are often packed with HFCS and other artificial ingredients. It\u2019s still a good idea to limit the amount of juice that you drink overall. As an alternative, pick up a piece of whole fruit and get the fiber benefits.\\n', 'Use caution when buying breakfast cereals and granola bars.:  Some granola bars actually have more sugar than their chocolate counterparts. Try replacing a sugar-filled cereal with steel-cut oatmeal instead.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"hfcs is also called: corn sugar, maize syrup, glucose syrup, fructose syrup, isolated fructose, and crystalline fructose","question_type":"['causal']","text_question":"How should I spot misinformation and misleading content on food labels?","question_id":"diy-39-4","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_external_fact"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-42","question":"How much garlic is needed to make this spray?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Make-Garlic-Garden-Spray","data_split":"test","original_answer":"You will need a head of garlic","history":"None","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Make Garlic Garden Spray', 'description': \"\\nGarlic isn't just a delicious and nutritious aromatic to use in the kitchen, and you can also use it in the garden.

This will greatly affect what vegetables will thrive in your garden. ","history":"None","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Start a Vegetable Garden', 'description': '\\nGrowing your own vegetable garden is a rewarding experience that allows you to save money while simultaneously creating a beautiful space in your yard. If you work closely with the land and put in the labor required to grow your own delicious vegetables, you will get an immense amount of satisfaction out of picking your brightly-colored gems and devouring them for dinner. Though planting a vegetable garden is probably easier than you think, there are some definite things to consider when planting a garden for the first time. Follow the instructions below to learn how to get started planting your very own vegetable garden.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Find out which USDA Plant Hardiness Zone you live in.:  Hardiness zones are based on the average minimum winter temperature in a given area and are divided into categories separated by 10-degrees Fahrenheit. They can tell you which plants will thrive in your area and which plants will not do well in the climate of your area. Additionally, you can find out when the best time of year to plant is based on your hardiness zone. Visit \\n', \"Choose a spot with at least six hours of direct sunlight per day.:  Most vegetables require a lot of sunlight to grow into healthy producers, but you may want to vary the sun to shade ratio of your garden to allow for some shade growing plants as well. However, if your vegetables don't get enough sun, they won't produce as much and will be more susceptible to pests. It's best to have an idea about what plants you want to grow before choosing a site.\\nYou can grow dark, leafy vegetables like broccoli and spinach in places in your garden that do not get full sun. If you live in an area with little sun, don't be discouraged. You can still plant a magnificent garden, though you'll probably have to leave tomatoes out of the equation.\\nAlternately, if you live in an extremely hot climate, you may want to choose partial shade for some of your vegetable varieties in order to protect them from extreme heat. For example, cool-season peas may benefit from growing in partial shade.\\n\", \"Know when to plant.:  Most vegetables are planted outside around the last spring frost and are harvested anywhere between mid-summer and late-fall. Consult the specific growing instructions for each type of vegetable that you grow. To enjoy a wide variety of vegetables for the entire growing season, plant vegetables that are ready for harvest at different times of the year. That way, you won't be without fresh vegetables for long.\\n\\nYou can also space out plantings of your vegetables. For example, to get a continuous harvest of lettuce, sow new lettuce seeds each week during the planting season.\\n\", 'Know how much to plant.:  Often, new gardeners get over-excited about their new hobby and end up planting more than they can eat or care for. Be aware that some plants, like tomatoes, peppers, and squash produce throughout an entire growing season, and others like carrots, radishes, and corn, produce only once.\\nFor best results, plant a mixture of continual producing and single producing vegetables in your garden. Generally, you can plant less of the continual producing vegetables and more of the single producing vegetables in order to achieve a good balance in your garden.\\nMake sure you give each plant enough space to develop and thrive in your garden. You may have to thin plants out as they begin to grow in order to avoid crowding.\\n', \"Ask your family which vegetables they love to eat.:  Keep your family's favorite vegetables in mind when planting your vegetable garden. By growing the produce you buy the most of, you can greatly reduce your grocery store costs, as well as reduce waste when it comes time to harvest.\\n\\n\", 'Consider growing vegetables that are hard to find.:  Many grocery stores only carry the produce basics. Often grocery stores simply carry one variety of a tomato or a pepper, making it hard to find interesting heirloom or exotic varieties. If your climate permits, consider planting vegetables that are difficult to locate for purchase in your area. Not only will doing so allow you to cook with special vegetables, it also provides you with a great gift to give to your friends, family, and neighbors.\\n\\n', 'Avoid plants that animals and pests in your area will eat.:  Be aware of the different vegetables that your local fauna will love to devour. To protect your vegetables from birds or deer, you may have to put up some sort of fence covering around your vegetable garden to prevent it from getting attacked by veggie-seeking predators.\\n\\n', 'Decide whether to grow from seed or transplant seedlings.:  Most vegetables can be grown from seeds or bought as seedlings and transferred directly into the ground or a planter box.\\n\\nWhile some vegetables like carrots are very easy to grow from seed, others like tomatoes can be a bit more difficult. Research the process for planting each type of vegetable from seed before choosing a planting method.\\nYou may also want to start seeds indoors in peat pots before transplanting seedlings in the garden. Consult a growing guide for each vegetable in order to figure out planting times and the temperature that most vegetables can withstand.\\nLook for plant sales in the spring. Many farmers markets and master gardener programs host annual plant sales. This will also give you a chance to get expert information from the person who started the plants.\\n', \"Space your plants adequately.:  While some gardening guides suggest planting in rows, others suggest that planting each vegetable type in a triangular shape actually allows you to preserve space in the garden. The important thing, though, is that your plants are not planted too tightly together to prevent them having to compete with neighboring plants for space.\\n\\nLook at the seed packet or the label on the plant's pot to see the provided spacing recommendations.\\n\", 'Learn how to care for your specific plants.:  Each type of vegetable plant requires a slightly, if not drastically, different care routine. Do a bit of research to find out how much water your plants need, whether or not they require trimming or thinning, how often they need to be fertilized, and when they are ready for harvest.\\n\\nMost plants benefit from a layer of mulch on top of the soil. This helps regulate temperature, retains moisture, and encourages beneficial earthworms.\\n', \"Choose your garden foundation.:  Decide whether you want to plant your vegetable garden directly in the ground or build a planter box to raise your vegetables a few feet above the ground. Alternately, you may want to plant different vegetable varieties each in their own pot. Your decision should depend on the quality of your soil and the tendency of your planting area to flood. If you have poor soil quality and poor drainage, you probably want to build a \\nThink about how big you want your planting bed to be. Depending on the type of vegetables you plant, you'll need to make sure that the box is wide and deep enough. Conduct a bit of research on the types of vegetables you are planting to see how much space they need to grow. Broccoli, for example, utilizes a wide area to grow, while carrots simply need space to grow down.\\nTo build a raised planting bed, you can use lumber, plastic, synthetic wood, bricks, or rocks. However, cedar planks are generally recommended because they do not rot when exposed to water. Keep in mind that your vegetable plants will have to be watered regularly, and some weak woods like simple plywood may not last very long when constantly drenched.\\nRound the top of your planting bed to achieve the maximum surface area for planting. This means that the tops are rounded to form an arc rather than a flat surface.\\nLay a barrier between the bed and the ground in order to prevent weeds from growing. You can use gardening plastic, a mat of some sort, or several layers of newspaper and\/or cardboard to reduce the chance that weeds will grow.\\n\", 'Till the soil.:  Most vegetables require a rich, fertile, fluffy soil to grow well. Use a quality garden hoe and\/or a shovel to intensely break up the soil and prepare it for planting. You can avoid this labor altogether if you choose to build a raised vegetable garden box and fill it with pre-mixed, store-bought soil.\\n\\nMake sure your planting area is free of any rocks or clumps of thick soil to allow the roots to expand and your seedlings to grow into healthy, productive plants.\\nBe sure to remove any weeds or unwanted voluntary plants from your growing space. These will just compete with your plants for space and can potentially bring in harmful pests.\\n', \"Test the pH of the soil.:  Soil pH is based on a scale of 1 to 14, with a pH of 7.0 being neutral, any values below 7.0 being acidic, and any values above 7.0 being alkaline. Most vegetables like a slightly acidic soil between 6.0 and 6.5. Soil that is too acidic will damage plant roots and cause your vegetables to under produce. \\nThe pH of the soil tells you if the soil needs limestone added in order to bring it to the desired pH value. Limestone is cheap and effective when it comes to improving soil.\\nEvaluate the soil's calcium and magnesium levels in order to determine what type of limestone to add to your soil. If the soil is low in magnesium, add dolomitic limestone. If it is high in magnesium, add calcitic limestone.\\nAdd the limestone two to three months before planting to allow the soil to absorb it. After adding, check the pH again. You will probably need to add limestone to the soil every year or two to maintain a proper pH level.\\n\", 'Fertilize the soil.:  Most vegetables like soil that is rich in organic matter. You can increase the fertility of your soil by adding peat moss, mature compost, blood meal, fish emulsion, etc. The most common fertilizers recommended for vegetable gardens specifically are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\\n\\nUse soil test results to let you know what you need to add. Do-it-yourself soil tests are readily available from most home improvement and garden stores.\\nTry one of these common fertilizer compositions in your vegetable garden: one pound of a 10-10-10 fertilizer or two pounds of a 5-10-5 fertilizer per 100 feet (30.5\\xa0m) of garden. The first number refers to the percentage by weight of nitrogen, the second number explains the percentage by weight of phosphorus, and the third number denotes the percentage by weight of potassium.\\nAlternatively, you can use a longer lasting, more sustainable fertilizer such as manure compost or aged animal manure. Add it to your garden before tilling and it can feed your plant for months.\\nToo much nitrogen can damage the plants, however, causing a reduction in production yield. Alternately, too much phosphorus can increase the chances of chlorosis.\\nYou can also add iron, copper, manganese, and zinc in small amounts to nourish the soil.\\n', 'Water the soil thoroughly.:  Most vegetables do not fare very well in times of drought. Make sure to water the soil before planting your vegetables seeds or seedlings and keep the bed moist throughout the growing process.\\n\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"find out which usda plant hardiness zone you live in","question_type":"['navigation']","text_question":"I would like to start a Vegetable Garden at home.

Spray it onto the mold with a spray bottle and let sit for 3 to 5 minutes, then dry with a clean towel. No scrubbing is necessary, but you may need to apply it up to 3 times.\\n', 'Try diluted chlorine bleach.:  Bleach is another effective mold killer, but can irritate the skin, lungs, and eyes if used in poorly ventilated areas or when mixed with other cleaning products.

In warmer climates, gerbera daisies can be grown in the garden as perennials, but in cooler climates they're grown outdoors as annuals. Gerbera daisies also grow well in containers. This is convenient because you can bring the flowers in when it gets too cold. The trick with caring for gerbera daisies is providing the right amount of water for them to flourish.\\n\\n\", 'steps': ['Aim to start the seeds indoors in early spring.:  Gerbera daisies can\u2019t be planted outside until the frost is done and the soil has started to warm. To give the seedlings a head start, you can start the seeds inside before that so they\u2019ll be ready for transplanting in late spring or early summer.\\n\\nStarting the seeds indoors early will also help to ensure that you get blooms this growing season.\\n', 'Fill a seed tray with a seed starting mix.:  Seed starting mix is a soilless potting mix that\u2019s lighter than typical potting soil, so it\u2019s better for germinating seeds. When the tray has been filled, use a spray bottle to moisten the mix in each cell. You can also make your own seed starting medium by combining equal parts:\\nVermiculite\\nPerlite\\nPeat moss\\n', 'Plant the seeds.:  Use the sharpened tip of a pencil or a toothpick to poke a hole in the center of the medium in each seed cell. The hole should be about \\n', 'Water the seeds.:  Use a mister or small watering can to moisten the potting medium and help settle the seeds. As the seeds germinate, water as necessary to keep the soil slightly moist but not soggy.\\n', 'Cover the tray with plastic.:  You can place a seed starter dome over the tray, or use a sheet of plastic wrap to cover the top. This will keep the seeds warm and keep moisture in the soil as the seeds germinate. You can remove the plastic in 2 to 3 weeks once the seeds have sprouted.\\nYou won\u2019t have to water as often when the plastic is on the tray, but may have to water daily to keep the medium moist once the plastic comes off.\\n', 'Place the seeds somewhere bright.:  Choose a bright windowsill or other area where the seeds will get about 8 hour of indirect light every day. The bright light and plastic will also keep the seeds warm and encourage germination.\\n', \"Wait for the daisies to develop two sets of leaves.:  After the seeds have germinated, the gerbera daisy seedlings will continue to grow. The seedlings aren't ready to be transplanted outside until they\u2019ve grown two sets of leaves (four leaves in total), and the soil has started to warm in the late spring or early summer.\\n\\nEven if the seedlings have two sets of leaves, don\u2019t transplant them until the threat of frost has past.\\n\", 'Choose a location with morning sun and afternoon shade.:  Gerbera daisies are native to South Africa, so they don\u2019t tend to like temperatures above 70\\xa0\u00b0F (21\\xa0\u00b0C). Because of this, it\u2019s important to keep them out of the hot afternoon sun. They also like a lot of light, so the ideal location is somewhere that\u2019s bright and sunny in the morning but protected from direct sun in the afternoon.\\n', \"Amend the soil with compost.:  Gerbera daisies are particularly susceptible to rot if they're exposed to too much moisture. You can help improve soil drainage by tilling 2 inches (5.1\\xa0cm) of compost into the garden bed before planting. This will also enrich the soil and encourage better blooms.\\nInstead of compost, you can use peat or some other organic material.\\nIn areas with soil that has a very high clay content, consider amending the soil with sand as well to improve drainage. Otherwise, you can plant the daisies in containers.\\n\", 'Dig holes for the seedlings.:  Use your hand or a spade to dig holes that are just deep and wide enough for the root ball. If you plant the daisies too deep in the soil, the crowns will rot. The holes should be spaced 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46\\xa0cm) apart to allow adequate airflow between the plants.\\n', 'Plant the daisies in the soil.:  Gently remove the seedlings from the seed trays and place one seedling in each hole. Cover the root ball with soil and use your hands to gently firm the soil around the roots to secure the seedling in place.\\n\\n', 'Water the seedlings thoroughly to set them in the soil.:  Water the soil around the seedlings to avoid getting the plants wet. As the plants grow, water them deeply once a week to keep the soil evenly moist but not soggy. Avoid getting water on the blooms or leaves, as this can lead to rot.\\n\\nAlways water gerbera daisies in the morning so excess water will dry during the day.\\n', 'Fertilize the daisies monthly.:  It takes a great deal of energy to produce large and beautiful flowers, and you can help the daisies by providing regular nutrients. Once a month during spring, summer, and early fall, add an all-purpose liquid fertilizer to the water before watering the plants.\\n', 'Remove dead flowers to encourage new blooms.:  As the flowers bloom, watch them carefully so that you can snip them off as they start to wilt.

In warmer climates, gerbera daisies can be grown in the garden as perennials, but in cooler climates they're grown outdoors as annuals. Gerbera daisies also grow well in containers. This is convenient because you can bring the flowers in when it gets too cold. The trick with caring for gerbera daisies is providing the right amount of water for them to flourish.\\n\\n\", 'steps': ['Aim to start the seeds indoors in early spring.:  Gerbera daisies can\u2019t be planted outside until the frost is done and the soil has started to warm. To give the seedlings a head start, you can start the seeds inside before that so they\u2019ll be ready for transplanting in late spring or early summer.\\n\\nStarting the seeds indoors early will also help to ensure that you get blooms this growing season.\\n', 'Fill a seed tray with a seed starting mix.:  Seed starting mix is a soilless potting mix that\u2019s lighter than typical potting soil, so it\u2019s better for germinating seeds. When the tray has been filled, use a spray bottle to moisten the mix in each cell. You can also make your own seed starting medium by combining equal parts:\\nVermiculite\\nPerlite\\nPeat moss\\n', 'Plant the seeds.:  Use the sharpened tip of a pencil or a toothpick to poke a hole in the center of the medium in each seed cell. The hole should be about \\n', 'Water the seeds.:  Use a mister or small watering can to moisten the potting medium and help settle the seeds. As the seeds germinate, water as necessary to keep the soil slightly moist but not soggy.\\n', 'Cover the tray with plastic.:  You can place a seed starter dome over the tray, or use a sheet of plastic wrap to cover the top. This will keep the seeds warm and keep moisture in the soil as the seeds germinate. You can remove the plastic in 2 to 3 weeks once the seeds have sprouted.\\nYou won\u2019t have to water as often when the plastic is on the tray, but may have to water daily to keep the medium moist once the plastic comes off.\\n', 'Place the seeds somewhere bright.:  Choose a bright windowsill or other area where the seeds will get about 8 hour of indirect light every day. The bright light and plastic will also keep the seeds warm and encourage germination.\\n', \"Wait for the daisies to develop two sets of leaves.:  After the seeds have germinated, the gerbera daisy seedlings will continue to grow. The seedlings aren't ready to be transplanted outside until they\u2019ve grown two sets of leaves (four leaves in total), and the soil has started to warm in the late spring or early summer.\\n\\nEven if the seedlings have two sets of leaves, don\u2019t transplant them until the threat of frost has past.\\n\", 'Choose a location with morning sun and afternoon shade.:  Gerbera daisies are native to South Africa, so they don\u2019t tend to like temperatures above 70\\xa0\u00b0F (21\\xa0\u00b0C). Because of this, it\u2019s important to keep them out of the hot afternoon sun. They also like a lot of light, so the ideal location is somewhere that\u2019s bright and sunny in the morning but protected from direct sun in the afternoon.\\n', \"Amend the soil with compost.:  Gerbera daisies are particularly susceptible to rot if they're exposed to too much moisture. You can help improve soil drainage by tilling 2 inches (5.1\\xa0cm) of compost into the garden bed before planting. This will also enrich the soil and encourage better blooms.\\nInstead of compost, you can use peat or some other organic material.\\nIn areas with soil that has a very high clay content, consider amending the soil with sand as well to improve drainage. Otherwise, you can plant the daisies in containers.\\n\", 'Dig holes for the seedlings.:  Use your hand or a spade to dig holes that are just deep and wide enough for the root ball. If you plant the daisies too deep in the soil, the crowns will rot. The holes should be spaced 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46\\xa0cm) apart to allow adequate airflow between the plants.\\n', 'Plant the daisies in the soil.:  Gently remove the seedlings from the seed trays and place one seedling in each hole. Cover the root ball with soil and use your hands to gently firm the soil around the roots to secure the seedling in place.\\n\\n', 'Water the seedlings thoroughly to set them in the soil.:  Water the soil around the seedlings to avoid getting the plants wet. As the plants grow, water them deeply once a week to keep the soil evenly moist but not soggy. Avoid getting water on the blooms or leaves, as this can lead to rot.\\n\\nAlways water gerbera daisies in the morning so excess water will dry during the day.\\n', 'Fertilize the daisies monthly.:  It takes a great deal of energy to produce large and beautiful flowers, and you can help the daisies by providing regular nutrients. Once a month during spring, summer, and early fall, add an all-purpose liquid fertilizer to the water before watering the plants.\\n', 'Remove dead flowers to encourage new blooms.:  As the flowers bloom, watch them carefully so that you can snip them off as they start to wilt. Use sterilized garden shears to trim off dying flowers and leaves. This will encourage the plant to grow more flowers.\\nTo keep from having to remove spent blooms, you can instead cut blooms when they\u2019re fresh and bring them indoors. If you keep the flowers in water, they should last for several days.\\n', 'Choose a container with good drainage.:  The most important thing when growing gerbera daisies in pots is to choose a container with lots of drainage holes. Choose the smallest pot possible so you can easily move the plant outside as the weather allows. Growing gerbera daisies in pots is ideal if you:\\nLive in a cooler climate with cold fall and winter months\\nLive in a rainy climate where the plant will get too much water in the garden\\nLive in a climate where the relative humidity is often over 65 percent\\nHave high-clay soil that doesn\u2019t drain well\\n', 'Fill the container with a light potting mix.:  The ideal soil for gerbera daisies is a well-draining and fertile soil, such as a potting mix with lots of peat, perlite, or vermiculite mixed in. Fill the container and then moisten the soil with water using a mister.\\n', \"Dig up the daisies from the garden.:  If you're moving the plant from the garden to a container to overwinter it, use a spade to gently dig the soil around the roots to loosen them from the ground. When the root have been loosened, hold the plant by the base of the grow and gently lift it from the soil.\\n\\n\", \"Plant the daisy in the pot.:  Use a spade to dig a hole in the soil. The hole should be just large enough to accommodate the root ball. Transplant the daisy from the garden or the seed tray (if you're moving seedlings directly into pots) to the container and cover the roots with soil. Use your hands to gently pack the soil around the roots.\\n\\n\", 'Water the plant every 3 to 5 days.:  Gerbera daisies like soil that\u2019s evenly moist but never soggy or wet. A good test is to stick your finger 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) into the soil. If the soil feels dry, water the plant thoroughly. Otherwise, leave it for another day or two.\\nGerbera daisies tend to need less water during the winter months, but never let the soil dry out completely.\\n', 'Place the pot where it will get morning sun.:  The ideal temperature for gerbera daisies is around 70\\xa0\u00b0F (21\\xa0\u00b0C), so you don\u2019t want them in direct afternoon sun. To provide them with enough light, find a window that gets lots of direct morning sun, but that\u2019s shaded in the afternoon and only gets indirect light later in the day.\\nIn the warmer months during spring and summer, you can leave the potted gerbera daisy outside in an area with similar lighting conditions.\\n', \"Fertilize the plant monthly during growing periods.:  The plants will need additional nutrients in spring and summer when they're actively growing and producing flowers.  Every 30 days, dissolve a 15-5-15 fertilizer in the water before watering the plant to feed the daisies.\\n\", 'Deadhead old blooms.:  When the flowers on the plant start to wilt and die, remove them with clean gardening shears.

If there is standing water on the top of the soil, you\u2019ve watered too much and your soil likely has poor drainage. Check the moisture by sticking your finger into the soil down to the first knuckle.\\nWater once a week or more depending on your climate so the soil stays damp.\\n', 'Transplant moringas grown from seeds when they are 6 to 8\\xa0in (15 to 20\\xa0cm).:  When moringas reach this size, they will begin competing for resources in the soil and need to be moved to individual pots. Carefully use a ruler or transplant tool to loosen the soil around one of the seedlings. Lift the root system and place it into the pot.\\n', 'Keep your moringa in a sunny indoor or outdoor spot.:  To grow healthy and strong, your moringa tree will need around 6 hours of direct sunlight. Moringa trees are from a tropical climate, so they need the maximum amount of sunlight you can provide. Keep them in an area that receives full sun throughout the day.\\n', 'Water your moringa once a week.:  Even though moringas are drought-tolerant, they should still have a weekly watering while they are establishing. Put your finger into the soil up to the second knuckle. If it feels dry, water. Be careful not to overwater the soil, or else the roots will become waterlogged and possibly develop rot.\\nIf it has rained during the week, your moringa has gotten enough water for the week.\\n', 'Use pruning shears to cut back moringa trees.:  When moringas start to grow, they will grow rapidly over the course of a year. Once the trees reach 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0\\xa0m), cut them back so they are at your desired level. Any branches you remove can be dried and propagated to plant another tree.\\n', 'Store moringa indoors when temperatures are below freezing.:  If you live in a temperate climate, you will want to store your tree inside your home or in a greenhouse during the winter. Moringas are susceptible to the frost and will not survive through the winter.\\nMoringas can grow up to 6 feet (1.8\\xa0m) tall in a year, so plan accordingly with how much space you have available.\\nMoringa can be restarted each year with cuttings taken from the previous season. Cuttings from moringa trees are the same age as the tree it was cut from.\\n', 'Harvest seed pods when they are 3\u20448 to 1\u20442 inch (9.5 to 12.7\\xa0mm) in diameter.: 3\\nBoil the seed pods until they are soft and squeeze the inner flesh out to eat. The exterior of the pod is fibrous and inedible.\\n', 'Pull leaves after the moringa is 3 feet (0.91\\xa0m) tall.:  Moringa leaves are considered a \u201csuperfood\u201d and can be pulled at any time once the tree is over 3 feet (0.91\\xa0m) tall. This way, as you pull the leaves off by hand, the branches will have grown strong enough and won\u2019t break.\\nSteep the moringa leaves to make an herbal tea, or add them to your smoothies or salads for added nutrients.\\n', 'Grind the leaves into a powder.:  Dry the leaves in a dehydrator or by hanging them. Once the leaves feel crinkly and crispy, remove them from the stem by hand. To grind them into a powder, use a food processor or grinder until it is fine.\\nMoringa powder can be added to any meal 1 tsp (3 g) at a time.\\nThe leaves can also be dried or eaten fresh.\\n', 'Use moringa for medical and nutritional needs.:  Moringa is filled with antioxidants as well as necessary vitamins and minerals. People have eaten moringa to help combat inflammation, arthritis, stomach pains, and asthma.\\nThe roots of moringa have the aroma of horseradish and should not be eaten, since they contain toxins.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Moringa seeds', '2\\xa0US\\xa0gal (7.6\\xa0L) pot', 'Potting mixture of soil, sand, and compost', 'Watering can', 'Pruning shears', '15\\xa0US\\xa0gal (57\\xa0L) pot']}","extracted_answer":"put your finger into the soil up to the second knuckle. if it feels dry, water","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"How much water should I be using on a weekly basis?","question_id":"diy-54-5","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_external_fact"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-55","question":"I chose my paint.

Sugar cane grows in the tropics, and it can be grown in the warmer parts of the United States. Currently, sugar cane is grown commercially in Florida, Louisiana, Hawaii, and Texas. If you live in one of these states, you can grow your own sugar cane.

If you can't find sugar cane plants at your local garden center, it can often be found at roadside stands and farmer's markets. Asian groceries also often stock sugar cane plants.\\n\\nLook for long, thick stems, which are more likely to produce healthy new plants.\\nThe stems have joints, and a new plant will sprout from each one. Keeping this in mind, buy as many stems as you need to produce the size crop you want.\\n\", 'Split the sugar cane stems into foot-long pieces.:  Leave three to four joints per piece, to make it more likely that each piece will produce a few sprouts. If the stems have any leaves or flowers, go ahead and remove them.\\n\\n', \"Dig furrows in a sunny planting spot.:  Sugar cane stems are planted horizontally on their sides, in four-inch deep furrows, or trenches. They need full sun, so choose an area that isn't shaded. Dig furrows long enough to fit each piece of cane you're planting, and space the furrows one foot apart. \\n\\nUse a spade or hoe, rather than a shovel, to make it easier to dig the furrows.\\n\", 'Moisten the furrows.:  Use a hose to lightly moisten the furrows to prepare them for the sugar cane. Make sure the water has drained and there are no remaining puddles before you plant.\\n\\n', 'Plant the sugar cane.:  Place the stems horizontally into the furrows. Cover them with soil. Do not plant stems upright, or they will not grow.\\n\\n', \"Wait for the sugar cane to grow.:  In the spring, usually in April or May, shoots will start to grow from the nodes of the stems. You'll see them breaking through the soil to form individual sugar cane stalks, which will grow quite tall by summer's end. \\n\\n\", \"Fertilize the sugar cane with nitrogen.:  Since sugar cane is a type of grass, it thrives on nitrogen-rich fertilizers. You can fertilize the sugar cane plants with standard grass fertilizer, or go for an organic option: chicken manure. Fertilizing just once, when the sprouts first emerge, will help the sugar cane grow strong and healthy so you'll have a good harvest in the fall.\\n\\n\", 'Weed the plant bed regularly.:  Sugarcane requires little maintenance except for weeding. Weeds could choke the new sprouts before they have the chance to grow. Constant weeding is necessary until the canes grow large enough to produce shade and choke harmful weeds on their own.\\n\\n', 'Monitor for pests and disease.:  A number of pests and diseases can impact sugar cane. Pests such as borers and insects are more likely to impact a crop when they experience waterlogged conditions, while diseases can cause fungal growth and rot stocks. Check your sugar cane regularly for pests or rotting, and take preventative measures to discourage pests and diseases whenever possible.\\n\\nSelecting sugar cane varieties that are resistant to diseases and viruses known to affect crops in your area is one of the best pest management strategies.\\nThe application of controlled amounts of appropriate fungicides or pesticides may help prevent the propagation of a pest or disease within your crop.\\nIf you do spot a plant that appears to be infected with pests or a disease, remove it immediately.\\n', \"Wait until fall to harvest.:  Sugar cane plants should be left to grow for as long as possible before the first frost of the year. If they are left in the ground after the first frost, you will not be able to use your plants to make sugar syrup.\\n\\nIf you live in a place with long, cold winters, play it safe and harvest your sugar cane by the end of September.\\nIf you live in a place with mild winters, you may be able to let your sugar cane grow until late October.\\nIf you live in the United States, you can check your area's frost dates by visiting\\n\", \"Use a machete to cut the canes close to the ground.:  The mature stalks will be tall and thick, similar to bamboo, so simple garden shears won't cut it. Use a machete or a saw to cut the sugar cane as close to the ground as possible, so you'll be able to make use of as much of the plant as possible.\\n\\n\", \"Don't hack into the ground.:  You don't want to damage the roots of the established sugar cane plants. If you leave the roots in the ground, your sugar cane will come up again next year.\\n\\n\", \"Strip the leaves from the cut sugar cane.:  Be sure to wear gloves since the leaves are quite sharp. Use them to cover up the planting bed. The leaves will act as an organic mulch that will protect the sugar cane roots over the winter. If you don't have enough leaves to cover the whole bed, use some extra straw to finish the job.\\n\", \"Scrub the stems.:  After a season outside, they'll have mildew and dirt on them. Use warm water and a scrub brush to scrub dirt and debris from the stems until they're completely clean.\\n\", \"Chop the stems into one-inch sections.:  The stems will be quite stiff, so a meat cleaver is a better tool for the job than a knife. Chop the stem into small sections, then chop those in half so you have a pile of small pieces of sugar cane.\\nIf you had a commercial sugar cane press, chopping the stems wouldn't be necessary. On large farms, juice is extracted from sugar cane using huge, heavy presses. There is no equivalent machine suitable for home use, so the chop-and-boil-method is used instead.\\n\", \"Boil the sugar cane pieces in a large stockpot filled with water.:  The sugar is extracted through a long process of boiling the pieces down for about two hours. The sugar water is ready when it has the same flavor as a piece of raw sugar cane. You'll have to taste-test it to determine when it's ready.\\nAnother clue is to look at the sugar cane pieces. After a few hours, the color will turn to a light brown, which indicates the sugar has been extracted.\\nCheck the pot every half hour or so to make sure that the pieces are still covered with water; if not, add more.\\n\", \"Pour the sugar water through a strainer into a smaller pot.:  Use the strainer to catch all the fibrous pieces of sugar cane. You don't need these anymore, so you can discard them.\\n\\n\", \"Cook down the sugar water to turn it into syrup.:  Boil the sugar water until it cooks down significantly and takes on the texture of thick syrup. This can take anywhere from one to two hours, so be sure to monitor the pot to make sure you don't overcook it. To test whether the syrup is ready, dip a cold spoon in the pot and check the texture.\\nIf you like your syrup on the thin side, you can remove it from heat when it still easily slides from the back of the spoon.\\nFor thicker syrup, remove it from heat when it coats the back of the spoon instead of slipping right off.\\n\", 'Pour the syrup into a glass canning jar.:  Place a lid on the jar and allow the syrup to cool completely before storing it in a cool, dry place.\\n\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"use a machete to cut the canes close to the ground","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"What is the best tool to cut the sugar cane?

The flies have a lifespan of 8-10 days but are able to lay as many as 500 eggs at a time when they reach maturity. Ripening fruit is not the only place they reproduce. They also grow in moisture-inhabited places like drains, sponges, garbage disposals, and empty bottles. Their accelerated lifespan paired with their rapid multiplication means the cycle of fruit flies will be never ending. Along with fruit flies, drain flies and common house flies can be frustrating and annoying pests. There are ways, however, to stop these insects dead in their tracks.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Eliminate the obvious sources of attraction for fruit flies.:  Place ripened fruit and vegetables out of sight and into the refrigerator to prevent fruit flies from having a breeding source. Throw any rotten produce away.\\n', 'Empty recycling bins and trash cans regularly to avoid fruit flies and houseflies.:  Clean the sides and bottom of the garbage can and bin so that they are free of food and juices on their surfaces.\\nAvoid getting potential spills from cans and bottles on your trash cans and recycle bins by cleaning them out before they are thrown away.\\nFor spills and regular cleaning, spray trash can and recycling bin surfaces with an all-purpose cleaner and wipe it dry with a paper towel.\\nAvoid overwatering houseplants to prevent fungus gnats.\\n', 'Rinse dirty dishes immediately to prevent fruit flies and houseflies.:  Allowing dishes to sit in the sink should be avoided, but if you must leave them there overnight, rinse them thoroughly to prevent flies using them as a breeding ground.\\n', 'Replace old sponges, dishrags, and mops regularly to reduce fruit flies.:  Toss your sponges every month and wash dishrags at least once or twice a month because bacteria and flies are attracted to warm, damp areas.\\n', 'Make sure your drains and garbage disposals are regularly maintained to prevent drain flies.:  Drains should be clean and clog free and there should be no stagnant water in kitchens or bathrooms.\\nClean drains and garbage disposals with a mixture of 1\/8th ammonia and a gallon of tap water. Allow it to sit and then rinse it down with running water.\\nSpray drains with Insect Growth Regulator to prevent future infestation by halting the growth process of fly eggs living in the drain.\\n', 'Place a funnel trap in your kitchen to trap fruit flies.:  Heat half a cup of apple cider vinegar and pour it into a wine bottle or jar. With a sheet of paper, form a cone-shaped funnel with tape and stick it to the jar.\\nAlthough fruit flies do not tend to be clever enough to leave the funnel jar once they\u2019ve entered, adding a drop or two of dish soap can help prevent flies from being able to fly away once they\u2019ve entered the jar.\\nWhile apple cider vinegar is commonly used as bait for this DIY trap, a piece of ripe banana can also be used and be just as effective.\\n', 'Use a jar trap with fruit to get rid of fruit flies.:  Place several pieces of very ripe, borderline rotting fruit at the bottom of a jar. Cover the opening with plastic wrap, securing it with a rubber band.\\nWith a toothpick, poke holes into the plastic wrap. This will be how fruit flies enter your trap.\\nTo kill the flies that gather there, submerge the jar underneath soapy water for about 10 minutes. Rinse the jar out, refill it with produce, and repeat the trapping effort.\\n', 'Use a similar jar trap to get rid of houseflies.:  Take two cups of water and some sugar and place it into a jar. Take a sheet of paper and fold it into a paper funnel with the wide side up at the top of the jar. Houseflies will be attracted to it and won\u2019t know how to fly back out.\\n', 'Combine milk, raw sugar, and ground pepper into a pan and bring it to a simmer.:  After 10 minutes, place the mixture into dishes placed around the house. Add a couple of drops of dish soap to the plates if fruit flies seem to be flying away.

Repeat this action five consecutive nights to get rid of everything that\u2019s down there.\\nAfter you\u2019re confident that the infestation has been killed, follow up with a natural method of pouring vinegar or bleach down the drain. Keep the drain flies at bay by using a drain gel one night a week.\\n', 'Fill a spray bottle with rubbing alcohol to kill common flies in the kitchen.:  Use the spray to instantly kill flies that hover around in the infested areas around the kitchen. \\n', 'Use a vodka based repellent to kill houseflies and fruit flies.:  Mix vodka, aloe vera juice, lemon eucalyptus oil, and an essential oil blend into a spray bottle.

If you hear a crackling sound, the bamboo has not been soaked long enough, and needs to be placed back in the water.\\n', 'Draw your desired shape.:  Take a large sheet of paper and sketch out the shape you want you bamboo to take. Place this paper on top of your large piece of plywood.\\n', 'Nail the design.:  Using the sketch as your guide, hammer nails into the plywood, following the sketched shape. Each nail should be approximately an inch apart.\\n\\nHammer in a second row of nails. This row should run parallel to the shape you just nailed and the distance between the two rows should be slightly larger than the diameter of the bamboo.\\n', 'Shape your bamboo.:  Once your bamboo has been adequately soaked and is pliable, remove it from the water and place it on the plywood between the nails. Allow the bamboo to dry 1-3 days.\\n\\nYou can test whether your shape has been set by picking the bamboo off the board. If the bamboo retains the desired shape, it has finished drying into shape.\\n', 'Cut your bamboo.:  Make a V-shaped cut right beneath one of the bamboo nodes. A node is one of the joints in the bamboo pole that looks like a knee and divides the cane into segments.\\nMake your cut narrow if the bend you desire is slight.

Do not rub too vigorously or for too long so that the paint job is not damaged.\\nMineral spirits and alcohol wipes should be tried separately.  Use the previous directions and try with mineral spirits.  If that fails, use readily available 91% isopropyl alcohol instead of mineral spirits.  Alcohol evaporates quickly and although your cloth will seem wet, it is the water that is left after the alcohol evaporates.

Snowball trees are known for their large, globular white blooms that emerge in early spring. Transplant a small snowball sapling into your garden or grow it from a branch cutting from an existing tree. Once your shrub blooms, trim it occasionally to keep your snowball tree happy and healthy!\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Pick the right spot to plant the sapling.:  Snowball trees are generally hardy plants that can withstand most climates. However, if you live in a particularly hot climate, choose a spot in your garden where the plant is shaded for at least part of the day. Snowball trees grow best in well-drained, slightly acidic soil.\\nFully grown snowball trees can grow from 12-20 feet tall and wide. Plan your garden accordingly so that your tree doesn\u2019t end up infringing on other plants!\\nBuy a snowball tree sapling at a local gardening store or at an online gardening retail site.\\n', 'Remove grass and weeds from the spot.:  After you have decided on a spot to plant your tree, remove any weeds, rock or debris from the area. This gives the tree a more hospitable environment so that it can grow without interference. Removing weeds also eliminates the competition for nutrients and water in the soil.\\n', 'Dig a small hole for the bulb.:  Dig a small hole about three times the diameter and just deep enough for the root ball. Use your hands or a small shovel to dig the hole. Discard any rocks or stones you may find while digging.\\n', 'Place the bulb of the sapling into the hole.:  Carefully take the snowball sapling out of its container. Use your fingers to gently loosen the visible roots of the bulb away from the sides so that they stick out from the bulb. Then lower the bulb into the hole.\\nMake sure that the point of the sapling where the trunk meets the roots is 1 \u00bd to 2 inches above ground level.\\n', 'Fill the hole up with soil.:  Take the soil that you discarded when you were digging and backfill the hole. Pat the soil around the bulb to eliminate any space between the bulb and the surrounding earth to ensure that the bulb is protected from the elements.\\n', 'Spread 4 inches of mulch around the tree.:  Transplanting can be shocking to a sapling, and the tree will need extra nutrients to ensure it can flourish in its new location. Spread a 4-inch deep layer of mulch over the whole planting area. Mulch enriches the soil and also helps to retain moisture and discourage weed growth.\\n', 'Find softwood branches on the parent tree.:  Another way to grow a snowball tree is to grow new plants from cuttings taken from the stems of a fully grown snowball tree, or parent plant. To test if a branch has reached the ideal softwood stage, bend the branch. If the branch bends, then breaks into two pieces, it is at the softwood stage.\\nIf the branch bends but doesn\u2019t break, it is too immature and likely won\u2019t develop into a new tree.\\nTake cuttings from the parent tree between March and July.\\n', 'Cut the branch 6 inches from its end.:  Use a sharp pair of gardening shears to cleanly cut a 6-inch length of branch. Make sure that the branch has at least two sets of leaves along its length. Try to make the cutting in the morning before the sun comes up to ensure that the shoots are well hydrated.\\nEven if you only want to end up with one snowball tree, make several cuttings. Because cuttings don\u2019t have a 100% success rate of blooming into plants, it\u2019s better to use two or three cuttings than to put all of your hopes on just one.\\n', 'Remove blossoms and leaves.:  Use your fingers or a small pair of clippers to remove blossoms from the stem of the tree, making the cut close to the stem. Also peel off the leaves on the lower half of the branch, peeling close to the branch. This is the area of the branch from which roots will eventually grow when you plant the cutting.\\n', 'Dip the branch into rooting hormone powder.:  Rooting hormone powder betters the chances that the cutting will bloom into a plant. Pour the powder into a small bowl, and then dip the branch into the bowl, making sure that the powder covers the leaf nodes where you peeled away the leaves.\\n', 'Prepare a seedling flat with potting mix.:  Purchase a seedling flat with drainage holes in the bottom to plant your cuttings. Fill the flat with a well-drained potting mix that contains around 60% sand or perlite and 40% sphagnum peat.\\n', 'Plant the cuttings in the flat.:  Poke your finger into the potting mix to make a hole that is about 2 inches deep. Then insert a cutting into the hole you made, making sure that the end of the branch with the leaf nodes you trimmed is going into the soil and that the leaf nodes are completely covered.\\n\\nPress the potting soil around the trimming so that it can stand upright in the container without falling over.\\nWater the potting mixture so that the soil is evenly moist.\\n', 'Cover the cuttings with a plastic bag.:  Place the tray into a large plastic bag, tenting the top so that the bag doesn\u2019t touch the top of the cuttings. The plastic bag will ensure that water doesn\u2019t evaporate away from the cuttings as they start to take root.\\nIf you are having trouble keeping the plastic bag from touching the tops of the cuttings, tape tall straws onto the corners of the seeding tray and settle the bag on top of the straws.\\nCheck the tray every now and then and water the soil when it is dry.\\n', 'Remove the plastic bag when the cuttings starts to root.:  After about four to six weeks, the cuttings should start to grow roots. To check for roots, gently brush away the potting soil from the base of the plant, or very gently tug at the plant to see if there is some resistance from the roots. When you notice roots, remove the plastic bag and water regularly to keep the soil moist.\\n\\n', 'Transplant the cuttings into pots.:  After about one week from time you removed the plastic bag, transplant the cuttings into small pots filled with potting soil. Do this by gently lifting the plants from the tray, making sure not to break any of the roots. Place the plants into a small hole in the potting soil, then press soil around the base of the cuttings. Water evenly to keep the soil moist.\\nIf more than one cutting took root, transplant them into separate pots.\\nIf you wish, you can transplant the snowball trees into the garden two to three weeks after you transplant them into the pots. Make sure not to forgo the potting step before transplanting into a garden.\\n', 'Use slow-acting fertilizer about four weeks after planting.:  Reinvigorate the soil by sprinkling a slow-acting fertilizer around the snowball tree a month after you\u2019ve put it in the ground. Slow-acting fertilizer delivers nutrients over a long period of time to keep your plant healthy.\\n', 'Remove dead or damaged branches.:  Cut off dead blooms or branches during blooming season, which takes place from March to July. Trimming dead growths from the plant will make the branches grow back healthier and bushier.\\n\\nUse a sharp pair of gardening shears to cut off the damaged section.\\n', 'Remove suckers close to the base of the tree.:  Suckers are offshoots of the snowball tree that look like thick branches growing on ground level. Because suckers are offshoots of the tree, they cause the tree to divide its nutrients and resources between the main part of the tree and the suckers. Use pruning shears to cut the sucker cleanly close to where its base meets the tree.\\nRemoving suckers allows the tree to retain all of its nutrients, making it much healthier.\\n', 'Water when the soil is dry.:  Check on your plant every week or so. If your area is experiencing a drought or has had very little rain, water your snowball tree. This is especially important when your tree is young and delicate.\\n\\nBe sure to water at the base of the plant instead of over the top of the plant. Watering at the base ensures that the roots absorb the water.\\n', 'Keep an eye out for common pests.:  From time to time, your snowball tree may fall prey to insect or rodent infestations. Here are some pests you should watch for:\\n\\nTiny, sucking insects like aphids, mites, and scales. To treat, spray your trees with insecticide soap. If you\u2019re using concentrated soap, dilute it to one teaspoon per pint for mild infestations, and four teaspoons per pint for severe infestations.\\nRoot weevils, which look like white grubs with brown heads. To get rid of these pests, drench the foliage in insecticide soap two to three times per week. Repeat every three weeks until the weevils are gone.\\nViburnum leaf beetle eggs, which look like rows of tiny caps on the underside of leaves. Prune infested twigs and leaves. To prevent infestations, spray the plant in early spring with organic, pyrethrin-containing pesticides.\\n', 'Treat diseases and blights.:  There are two common diseases that affect snowball trees: verticillium wilts and canker. Verticillium wilts is a fungal disease that reduces water flow, resulting in yellowing or wilted leaves, stunted growth, and death. Canker is another fungal disease that kills the wood, leaving dead and deformed spots and eventually killing entire limbs.\\n\\nYou can treat verticillium wilts by pruning the affected limbs and foliage and sterilizing your tools regularly.\\nFor canker, remove the infected bark until you reach green wood, and be sure to sterilize your tools.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"water the potting mixture so that the soil is evenly moist","question_type":"['confirmation']","text_question":"Should I water them after planting them?","question_id":"diy-79-3","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_external_fact"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-79","question":"Does it matter what kind of fertilizer I use?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Grow-Snowball-Trees","data_split":"test","original_answer":"You just want to make sure that the fertilizer is slow acting","history":"student: Would leaving air pockets damage the plant in some way? | teacher: The air pockets will not damage the plant, but the space created will not ensure that the plant stays upright in the pot.

Known for its ability to neutralize bad breath, you can chew on the sprig of parsley garnishing your plate after your meal to freshen your breath. Parsley is an easy-to-grow biennial plant in mild climates, and an annual in cold climates.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Choose a type of parsley.:  Parsley comes in two general varieties: curly leaf and flat leaf (also known as Italian parsley). Flat leaf parsley tends to have a slightly stronger flavor than that of curly-leaf parsley, but both types are relatively mild. You will also need to decide if you want to grow your parsley from seed, or if you will grow the plant from a start\/potted version.\\n\\n', 'Select a location.:  Parsley works well in any garden or pot, as it doesn\u2019t have strict growing conditions under which it thrives. Choose an area that gets at least partial sunlight, either in its own plot or between other garden plants. If you decide to pot your parsley, place it on a windowsill that gets morning sunlight, such as on an eastern-facing windowsill.\\n\\n', 'Prepare the soil.:  Soil that is relatively loose, full of compost\/nutrients, and has a pH level between 6 and 7 is perfect for parsley. Test the pH of the soil, and incorporate peat moss into it if the soil is too basic. To create the perfect soil mixture, mix 50% potting soil with 50% compost for nutrients. This will create a light and airy soil mixture that will make it easier for the small root-system of the parsley to attach itself to.\\n', 'Soak the seeds in soapy water.:  Fill a large cup or bowl with warm (not hot) water. Add a splash of dish soap, and stir the mixture to help it to dissolve. Place all of your parsley seeds into the mixture and allow them to soak for one hour. The heat of the water and the dish soap will help to break down the notoriously tough outer casing of the parsley seeds, helping them to grow faster than they would without soaking.\\n\\n', 'Rinse and move the seeds to another bowl of water.:  Using a small strainer, pour the soapy water out and run the seeds under lukewarm water. This should remove any traces of the soap, and prepare them for the next step. Fill a bowl with very warm water (near 105 degrees Fahrenheit) and place the seeds in the water. Leave these to soak overnight to continue the germination process.\\n\\n', 'Dry the seeds.:  After 24 hours soaking in the water, remove the seeds with a strainer and lay them out on a piece of wax paper to dry. When they have been fully dried, they are ready to be planted.\\n\\n', 'Start your seeds indoors.:  If you want to speed up your planting time even further, you can plant your parsley ahead of time in small containers and move them to their final destination after sprouting. 6-12 weeks prior to the last frost before Spring, plant your parsley seeds into small containers and water them daily. This should give them enough time to begin sprouting, increasing their time to full bloom when planted outdoors or in a larger pot.\\n', 'Plant at the right time.:  Wait until all possibility of frost has passed and sow the seeds directly in the garden if you did not start them indoors. Typically, the seeds should be planted at the very beginning of Spring, around March or April.\\n\\n', 'Dig your holes\/rows.:  Using a small trowel, make the rows in your garden approximately 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5\\xa0cm) apart and long enough so that the seeds can be sewn in 3-inch intervals. The seeds\/sprouts need only be covered with \u00bd inch of dirt, so these holes\/rows need not be very deep.\\n\\n', 'Plant outside.:  Transplant seedlings started indoors into your garden after the last frost and when the plants are at least 3-inches tall. Place the seeds so that each plant is at least 8 to 10 inches from the other plants, in rows that are 6 inches (15.2\\xa0cm) apart. This will give the parsley plenty of space to grow, which it will take full advantage of with the commencement of late Spring.\\n\\n', 'Water the parsley.:  Water your parsley deeply at least once a week to encourage the development of a long taproot. You may need to water more frequently during extremely hot and dry periods. If you\u2019re planting your parsley in pots indoors, give them enough water so that the soil is just barely moist. Consider setting up a drip system if you\u2019re unable to water the parsley regularly.\\n', 'Keep weeds at bay.:  Weeds can easily blend in with the parsley, but they take up valuable nutrients and block out sunlight. Mulch around the plants to help the soil retain its moisture and discourage weed growth. Further, pull any weeds on sight and dispose of them far away from your garden.\\n\\n', 'Thin out the parsley plants.:  Along the way, seedlings will need to be thinned out so that there is only one plant every 8 to 10 inches. Once the seeds start to develop into plants, go through with a pair of scissors and snip out some of the smaller or less healthy looking plants right down to the soil. If you want to transplant these seedlings to a different location, then you can carefully dig them up using a small spade.\\n', 'Continue adding nutrients.:  Fertilize the parsley once a month using a general purpose fertilizer to sustain production of the herb for the entire season. You can also add compost to the soil to help keep it full of nutrients, giving your parsley an extra boost.\\n\\n', 'Harvest the parsley.:  When the parsley sprouts out with sets of three leaves that are fully developed, it is ready to be picked. Harvest the parsley slowly throughout the season by cutting the outer stalks of the plants just above ground level to encourage additional growth. Harvesting the leaves from the top of the plant will reduce your yield.\\n\\n', 'Freeze the leaves for later use, or dry them and store them in airtight containers.:  Use your stored parsley within a year for optimal flavor.\\n\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"the seeds should be planted at the very beginning of spring, around march or april","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"When would be a good time to plant?

","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Make Bar Soap', 'description': '\\nMaking soap at home is a cost-effective and creative hobby. The simplest way to make bar soap at home is through the melt and pour method, which uses a melted soap base instead of active lye. To start from scratch, mix water, oils, and additives with lye. No matter which way you choose, you can enjoy custom soap bars with few chemical additives after the batter cures.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Cut a soap base into chunks that are easy to melt.:  Chop up about  1\\xa0lb (0.45\\xa0kg) of soap or glycerine into cubes \\nYou can also try shredding the soap with a grater or vegetable peelers.\\nGlycerine is a common base available online or at craft supply stores. It is made with lye like any bar of soap but doesn\u2019t have any active lye in it, so it\u2019s safe to touch.\\nChoose white and clear-colored soaps if you plan on adding coloring later. Darker soaps aren\u2019t as great for customizing, although you can still add fragrances and thickeners to them.\\n', 'Place the cut soap base into a heatproof pot or bowl.:  The container you need depends on how you plan on \\nIf you use a microwave, choose a microwave-safe. Look for a label on the bottom of the container or on its packaging.\\n', 'Heat and stir the soap constantly until it melts.:  Heat the soap on a stovetop or in your microwave to about 120\\xa0\u00b0F (49\\xa0\u00b0C). Move the melting soap around with a rubber spatula to help it melt. Don\u2019t let it sit still for more than 30 seconds or else it may burn. Stir it until it reaches a smooth consistency.\\n\\nIf the soap batter looks thick and dry, mix a little bit of water into it. Add water gradually, stirring the batter to keep it at a liquid consistency.\\nMany soap bases reach a good consistency within a couple of minutes. Depending on the base you use, you may need to keep stirring for 15 minutes or more to make the batter smooth.\\nIf you\u2019re using a microwave, heat the soap for 30 seconds at a time. Give it a good stir to distribute the heat.\\nSoap bases begin to burn around 140\\xa0\u00b0F (60\\xa0\u00b0C). Use a kitchen thermometer as needed to track the temperature.\\n', 'Add tea, salt, and other ingredients to color the soap.:  Fresh-brewed coffee and tea change the batter\u2019s color but don\u2019t often leave much of a smell in the finished product. Mix in some blended fruits or vegetables to give your soap a deep, vibrant color. Soap dyes are another option for unusual colors. Also, use colored salt and spices for additional variety.\\nFor example, add about 2.6\\xa0oz (74\\xa0g) of pink Himalayan sea salt to turn a batter pink, or mix in a little tumeric to give the batter an orange color.\\nBrew coffee and tea separately from the soap batter. Remove coffee grounds and tea bags before adding the liquid to the batter.\\n', 'Mix in essential oils and other ingredients to make your soap fragrant.:  Stir a few drops of any essential oil into your batter to customize it. Flowers and herbs are some alternatives to essential oils. Try using ingredients like powdered beet root or sandalwood. Ingredients like vanilla, honey, and brown sugar can also give your soap a pleasant quality that makes it difficult to put down.\\nWhole flowers and herbs lose color over time and may discolor your soap. Try placing them on top of the batter after you pour it into the mold instead of mixing them in.\\n', 'Use oils and other ingredients to change the soap\u2019s texture.:  For softer soap bars, heat cooking oil in a separate pan, then mix it into the batter. Olive oil, coconut oil, and vegetable oil are a few good options for softer, silkier soap bars. Some people melt glycerine cubes to add to the batter. To thicken the batter, add a scoop of oatmeal, honey, or beeswax.\\n\\n', 'Choose vegetable oils to form a base for your soap.:  You can use all kinds of vegetable oil to create soap. The type of oil you choose determines the amount of other ingredients you need. For your first time making soap, keep it simple by sticking to 1 or 2 different types of oils. Pomace olive oil from a grocery store is a common base to start with. Measure out 38\\xa0oz (1,100\\xa0g) of oil on a kitchen scale by weight instead of volume.\\nFor a recipe that is a little fancier than a basic olive oil soap, try pure hemp seed or palm oil. Mix the oil with equal parts olive oil.\\nFor a creamier soap with more lather, try mixing 1 part coconut oil, 1 part palm oil, and 1 part olive oil. Add some sweet almond oil to give the soap a pleasant scent.\\n', 'Use a lye calculator to determine how much lye you need to make soap.:  If you are following a specific soap recipe, use the amount of lye specified in the recipe. Otherwise, rely on a lye calculator. The amount of lye you need varies depending on the oil you use. Use the correct ratio of lye to oil to make solid bars of soap that don\u2019t sting your skin when you use them.\\nSearch online to find your own lye calculator or use the one at\\nAnother lye calculator is available at\\nSome calculators have an option for superfatting, which means using extra fat to make the soap softer. For a good default consistency, set the option at 5%.\\n', 'Pour the water into a heat-proof mixing bowl.:  For a basic olive oil soap, you need about 13.2\\xa0oz (370\\xa0g) of water. Measure out the water into a heat-safe glass or plastic measuring cup placed on a kitchen scale. Transfer the water into a stainless steel pot or glass bowl. Keep in mind that lye does corrode glass and plastic a little bit over time, so stainless steel is usually your best bet when mixing lye and water.\\nIf you\u2019re making a different type of soap, use the amount of water specified by the recipe or lye calculator.\\nTap water often has minerals that affect how your soap turns out. To avoid this, purchase distilled water from a grocery store.\\nIf you halved a recipe to make a small batch of soap, remember to halve every ingredient accordingly.\\n', 'Measure out the lye into a separate container on a kitchen scale.:  Carefully pour about 4.8\\xa0oz (140\\xa0g) of lye into a heat-safe glass or plastic measuring cup. Weigh it on the scale. Make sure you have the amount specified by your recipe or lye calculator. Handle it with caution to avoid spills, and use stainless steel or glass containers you don\u2019t plan on cooking with in the future.\\nLye is available online or at most hardware stores.\\nLye is very caustic, so handle it carefully. Cover yourself with protective goggles, rubber gloves, and long-sleeved clothing. If you get any on your skin, wash it off immediately with cold water.\\nThe most common type of lye is sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Potassium hydroxide (KOH), or potash, is also available and used in soap making. Read the label to figure out which type you have. They are similar but need to be added in different amounts.\\n', 'Pour the lye into the water gradually while stirring it.:  Stir the ingredients together with a stainless steel or heat-safe plastic whisk. Let the mixture warm up and turn white before adding more lye. Continue stirring and pouring until you finish dissolving all of the lye. The mixture will be scalding hot.\\nNever pour the water into the lye or dump all of the lye into the water at once. This can lead to a lye explosion splattering everything with dangerous chemicals.\\nLye and water release heat and fumes when mixed together. Make sure you\u2019re ready for this before continuing. Ventilate your area and consider wearing a dust mask.\\n', 'Test the lye water with a thermometer until it reaches 110\\xa0\u00b0F (43\\xa0\u00b0C).:   Set the container aside while you wait.

The simplest way to make bar soap at home is through the melt and pour method, which uses a melted soap base instead of active lye. To start from scratch, mix water, oils, and additives with lye. No matter which way you choose, you can enjoy custom soap bars with few chemical additives after the batter cures.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Cut a soap base into chunks that are easy to melt.:  Chop up about  1\\xa0lb (0.45\\xa0kg) of soap or glycerine into cubes \\nYou can also try shredding the soap with a grater or vegetable peelers.\\nGlycerine is a common base available online or at craft supply stores. It is made with lye like any bar of soap but doesn\u2019t have any active lye in it, so it\u2019s safe to touch.\\nChoose white and clear-colored soaps if you plan on adding coloring later. Darker soaps aren\u2019t as great for customizing, although you can still add fragrances and thickeners to them.\\n', 'Place the cut soap base into a heatproof pot or bowl.:  The container you need depends on how you plan on \\nIf you use a microwave, choose a microwave-safe. Look for a label on the bottom of the container or on its packaging.\\n', 'Heat and stir the soap constantly until it melts.:  Heat the soap on a stovetop or in your microwave to about 120\\xa0\u00b0F (49\\xa0\u00b0C). Move the melting soap around with a rubber spatula to help it melt. Don\u2019t let it sit still for more than 30 seconds or else it may burn. Stir it until it reaches a smooth consistency.\\n\\nIf the soap batter looks thick and dry, mix a little bit of water into it. Add water gradually, stirring the batter to keep it at a liquid consistency.\\nMany soap bases reach a good consistency within a couple of minutes. Depending on the base you use, you may need to keep stirring for 15 minutes or more to make the batter smooth.\\nIf you\u2019re using a microwave, heat the soap for 30 seconds at a time. Give it a good stir to distribute the heat.\\nSoap bases begin to burn around 140\\xa0\u00b0F (60\\xa0\u00b0C). Use a kitchen thermometer as needed to track the temperature.\\n', 'Add tea, salt, and other ingredients to color the soap.:  Fresh-brewed coffee and tea change the batter\u2019s color but don\u2019t often leave much of a smell in the finished product.

Typically, a soap contains no more than 6% additives by volume.\\nResearch the benefits of herbs and essential oils. For example, add lavender to scent the soap and nourish your skin.\\nOatmeal, coffee grounds, and honey are a few common thickeners that make soap coarser for exfoliation.\\n', 'Clean and line your soap molds.:  Soap molds are basically boxes for the liquid batter to set in. Any dry plastic container works, or you can buy silicone molds specifically for soap. If you have a wooden container, cover the inside with a silicone liner or freezer paper.\\nSoap molds are available online and at some general stores. If you need a liner, freezer papers are available at most supermarkets.\\n', 'Pour the soap batter into the mold.:  Fill each mold close to the top. Tap the mold against a hard surface a few times to break up air bubbles. Use a rubber spatula to scrape out excess batter to pour into a different mold or throw away.\\nBump the mold against a hard surface a few times if it looks frothy. Try dropping it from a low height to knock out stubborn air bubbles.\\nDon\u2019t worry about breaking the soap into smaller bars yet. Wait until the soap solidifies for that.\\n', 'Wrap the mold inside cardboard and a clean towel.:  Tape a piece of cardboard over the mold to cover the soap. Then, wrap a towel around the entire mold to insulate it. Doing this helps the mold set properly, leading to better soap.\\nIf you don\u2019t have cardboard, place parchment paper over the mold.\\n', 'Wait 24 hours before cutting into bars.:  The saponification process takes at least a day to happen. When you remove the soap from the mold, it will be hard and ready for cutting. Use a sharp kitchen knife to break the soap down into smaller bars. To smooth out the sides, scrape the soap with a vegetable peelers.\\nKeep your soap at room temperature and out of the reach of children and pets. If you used fresh lye, the soap is still dangerous to touch at this point.\\nIf your soap is too soft to cut, let it rest for an extra day. This happens most often in large, single molds.\\n', 'Dry the soap for several weeks before using it.:  Move the soap bars into a cool but well-ventilated area. Try placing them near a window in your basement or on a countertop. Put them on top of wax paper or another disposable material to prevent the oils from damaging the surface the soap is on. Soap takes about 4 weeks to finish curing.\\nSoap can take anywhere from 3 to 8 weeks to cure completely. The time it needs depends on the oils you used. Check your recipe for the recommended curing time.\\nSoap made using the melt and pour method typically solidifies within a few hours. At most, let it rest overnight before taking it out of the mold.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Pot or microwavable container', 'Measuring cup', 'Kitchen scale', 'Rubber spatula', 'Oven or microwave', 'Essential oils or other additives', 'Molds', 'Plastic wrap', 'Sharp knife', 'Lye', 'Vegetable oils', 'Safety goggles', 'Long sleeve shirt or coveralls', 'Long pants', 'Rubber, plastic, or latex gloves', 'Stainless steel, glass, or plastic mixing containers', 'Measuring cups', 'Kitchen scale', 'Stainless steel, glass, plastic, or wooden mixing tools', 'Stainless steel thermometers', 'Stove', 'Pot or pan for heating oil', 'Silicone, plastic, or wooden soap molds', 'Cardboard', 'Towel', 'Sharp knife', '1\\xa0lb (0.45\\xa0kg) goat\u2019s milk soap base', '2.6\\xa0oz (74\\xa0g) pink Himalayan salt', '20 drops grapefruit essential oil', '38\\xa0oz (1,100\\xa0g) pomace olive oil[1]\\nX\\nResearch source', '13.2\\xa0oz (370\\xa0g) distilled water', '4.8\\xa0oz (140\\xa0g) sodium hydroxide']}","extracted_answer":"use oils and other ingredients to change the soap\u2019s texture","question_type":"['causal']","text_question":"Is there a specific amount of oil to heat?

Whatever the cause, a quick jump is usually enough to get you charged and ready to hit the road again. All you need is a set of jumper cables and a working car or a portable jumping battery. We\u2019ll show you how to position and expose the batteries, hook up the cables, and get your car back in working order.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Park the vehicles so the batteries are near each other.:  Drive the vehicle with the live battery, which is the \u201cdonor\u201d car, towards the vehicle with the dead battery. Car batteries are typically located underneath the car\u2019s hood, so either park the cars next to each other or facing one another so that the hoods are close and easily accessible, and the \\n', 'Engage the parking brake on both cars.:  The parking brake ensures that the cars stay in place as you jump the battery. Use the gear stick if your car has one. Shift the car to \u201cP\u201d or \u201cPark\u201d to engage the brake. Setting the car to \u201cN,\u201d or \u201cNeutral,\u201d will also prevent it from rolling. If your car has manual transmission, set it to neutral, then engage the emergency brake.\\nThe emergency brake is usually located near the gear stick or gas pedal.\\n', 'Turn the cars off and remove the keys.:  Make sure the donor car is completely off. Listen to the engine shut down and test the radio to see that it doesn\u2019t have any power running to it. Also take the key out of the car with the dead battery so it can\u2019t start up when the jumper cables are attached.\\nDoing this protects both engines from power surges and reduces the risk of electrical shock.\\n', 'Clean the battery terminals with a wire brush or other coarse material.:  Pop the hood and examine the battery terminals for signs of dirt, corrosion, or leakage. If there\u2019s white or greenish discharge, \\nDo not try to jump batteries that have physical damage, like cracks or broken components. Physically damaged batteries may pose a risk of electrocution or damage to your car when jumped.\\n', 'Locate the positive and negative battery terminals in each car.:  The cables leading to the positive terminal are almost always red. The negative terminal\u2019s cables are black. Likewise, the terminals are often identified with red and black components or symbols such a \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d sign to mark the positive and negative terminals, respectively.\\n', 'Attach a red clamp to the positive terminal of the dead battery.:  Double-check the \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d labels on the battery before attaching the clamp. Squeeze the clamp to open it, then fit it securely around the metal terminal, so that the metal of the clamp is fixed to the metal of the terminal.\\nOn some vehicles, you may have to remove a plastic cover from the positive battery terminal before you can make this connection. Remove it by twisting it counterclockwise by hand, or by lifting the cap.\\nConnect each clamp 1 at a time, and work slowly and deliberately. Jumping a car with improperly connected cables can damage your car\u2019s electrical system or cause injury to yourself.\\n', 'Secure the other red clamp to the positive terminal on the donor battery.:  Carry the other red clamp to the other car and fit in on the positive terminal. Make sure it is secure so it won\u2019t slip off when the engine is activated later.\\nAs you attach the clamps, make sure no 2 clamps touch each other as you move them about or while they dangle freely, which may cause electrocution.\\n', 'Connect a black clamp to the negative terminal on the donor battery.:  Take the donor battery\u2019s corresponding black clamp and fit it directly on the black \u201c-\u201d terminal on the battery. Make sure not to touch it to the \u201c+\u201d terminal or the red clamps.\\nIf you attach a clamp incorrectly, stop and immediately remove the clamps carefully, working 1 at a time to avoid touching them together.\\n', 'Connect the other black clamp to an unpainted metal surface in the car.:  The black clamp of the dead battery does not connect to a battery terminal. Instead, find a bit of metal at least a foot away from the battery, such as a clean bolt in the engine block. You may also place the clamp on an unpainted part of the car\u2019s body underneath the hood.\\nThis clamp is \u201cgrounded\u201d away from the battery to eliminate the risk of a wayward spark combusting the hydrogen gas created in the air when the battery is jumped.\\nDon\u2019t dig too far down to find a metal surface. The fuel lines are deeper in the engine block and you are better off keeping the clamp away from them.\\nMake sure the jumper cable doesn\u2019t hang down into the engine compartment, since it can get caught by the moving parts within.\\n', 'Start the donor vehicle and let it idle for a few minutes.:  Use the ignition key to start the engine. The electrical systems, such as the lights and radio, will start while electricity flows to the dead battery. Give the battery at least 30 seconds to build power before you attempt to start the other car.\\nDepending on the dead battery\u2019s age and condition, it may require more time to charge, so let it run for an additional minute if your first attempt doesn\u2019t work.\\nStep on the gas pedal to run the RPM up to about 3,000 to drive more power towards the dead battery.\\n', 'Start the dead car\u2019s engine and let it run for 10-15 minutes.:  Turn the key in the ignition to activate the car. The electrical systems should immediately activate. If the lights, radio, or other electrical components don\u2019t come on, give the battery more time\u2014shut off the car, make sure the cables are attached properly, and then try revving the working car to increase the power supply.\\nIf the car doesn\u2019t start after repeated attempts, your car may have a different problem.

Like other accessories, there is a need to clean silk arrangements from time to time in order to keep them looking vibrant and new. For deep cleaning, you can wash your flowers in water or vinegar. To remove built-up dust, things like compressed air work well. Light dusting can help keep flowers clean on a regular basis. Vacuuming and blow-drying your flowers regularly can keep them clean and fresh.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Use a bag of rice.:  Rice can help pull unwanted dirt and grime off of flowers that have been sitting in storage for long periods. Place a cup of uncooked rice in a paper bag. Then, add your flowers. Give the bag a few good shakes and then remove the flowers. Some of the dust and dirt should come off this way.\\nThis can work great with dried flowers and wreaths as well.\\n', 'Shake your flowers in cornmeal.:  Cornmeal can help remove dust and grime from very dirty flowers. Fill a Ziploc bag with four to five tablespoons of cornmeal. Cornmeal can act as a tiny sponge and remove unwanted grime from flowers. Place the flowers in the bag and seal it. Shake the bag for about 60 seconds. When you remove the flowers, shake them lightly to remove excess cornmeal and then remove the flowers. Dust and dirt should be removed.\\n', 'Try compressed air.:  Compressed air can be used to remove small amounts of dust and dirt from silk flowers. You can buy compressed air at most department stores and then use it to remove dust and dirt from silk flowers.\\nYou can use the compressed air to blow light coverings of dust and dirt off the flowers.\\nHowever, you should avoid compressed air on very delicate silk flowers. It may cause petals to crumble.\\n', 'Use a hairdryer on low speed.:  If you have a hairdryer, you can use this on silk flowers. This may work on very delicate compressed flowers that would not respond well to compressed air. Turn the hairdryer to a low setting and use it to blow any unwanted dirt and grime from the flowers.\\nThis is very effective with very light layers of dust. Heavier dust or dirt may not respond as well to a hairdryer.\\n', \"Wash your flowers in water.:  If silk flowers have been in storage for a while, they may build up dirt and grime. In this case, you can wash flowers in water with dish soap in a sink full of warm water, mix in two to three tablespoons of gentle dish soap. You can then gently swish your flowers in the water.

Spray the flowers with a light amount of the mixture and then let them dry.\\nIf you've never exposed your flowers to water before, spritz a light amount of water on a small corner of the flowers to see if it causes damage first.\\n\", 'Try cleaning sprays.:  Many cleaning sprays are sold specifically for silk flowers. Some of these sprays can work well, but use discretion. Make sure the spray is designed for silk flowers, as sprays made for artificial flowers in general may not work on silk.\\n\\nYou should also keep in mind flower sprays may be more expensive than other methods.\\n', \"Use the dishwasher.:  If you have a dishwasher that can be a set to a gentle cycle, you can wash your flowers on the top rack without detergent. A mild amount of water will wash off set-in dirt and dust. However, make sure the manufacturer's instructions first as some silk flowers are not dishwasher friendly. This can result in your dishwasher getting stained and flowers getting damaged.\\nAs always, make sure your flowers respond well to water by adding a small amount to the flowers before washing them.\\n\", 'Use a duster.:  A regular duster, such as a feather duster, can be used on flowers on a regular basis. This does not work well for removing built-up dust or debris, but can remove a light gathering of dust. During your regular dusting, make a habit of lightly dusting silk flowers.\\nIf some of the dust is stuck on, use a soft bristle brush instead of a regular duster and brush them flower by flower. Do this outside to prevent getting dirt and dust on your floor.\\n', 'Vacuum your flowers.:  If you vacuum regularly, you may want to use a vacuum on silk flowers. Use a detachable hose and hold it a few inches away from your flowers. The vacuum cleaner should collect some of the dust.\\n', 'Try a blow dryer.:  A blow dryer can be used as part of your regular cleaning regimen in addition to removing set in dust.

Under-watering and over-watering can cause a variety of non-specific symptoms that sometimes overlap with other peace lily ailments. However, since improper watering is also one of the easiest problems to fix, try attempting these remedies first before moving on to a more drastic solution.\\n\\nUnder-watering should be fairly obvious: dry soil accompanied with wilting, yellowing leaves and a drooping stalk is a dead giveaway. Fix this by watering and misting more regularly - at least once a week for each. Note that plants that outgrow their containers will have a difficult time absorbing the water they need from a typical watering session.\\nOver-watering can be slightly harder to diagnose, but is often characterized by brown leaf tips. Note that over-watering can lead to root rot, a separate, much more serious condition.\\n', 'Repot a plant with root rot.:  Root rot is serious condition that can affect any potted plant with roots below the surface and can easily kill the plant. Generally, root rot is caused when a plant suffers from over-watering or poor drainage. If the roots are held in contact with standing water for a prolonged period of time, it becomes difficult for them to get the air that they need to function correctly, and as a result they will literally begin to rot. Certain types of microorganisms called water moulds contribute to the spreading rot, the spores of which can spread root rot to another plant if adequate moisture is present. Root rot is often fatal, but, to attempt to remedy it, immediately remove your lily from its pot and cut off any dead, slimy, or otherwise rotten portions of root. Pot the plant in a new pot with dry soil and proper drainage.\\n\\n\\nThough root rot infects the plant below the surface, it will cause the plant to visibly begin to die above ground.

Growing tomatoes hydroponically allows the grower to raise them in a controlled environment with less chance of disease, faster growth, and greater fruit yield. However, hydroponic gardening is much more labor intensive, and sometimes more expensive, than ordinary tomato planting, especially if you have not set up or run a hydroponics system before.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Decide which type of system to use.:  There are several varieties of hydroponic systems, and tomatoes can grow well in any of them. The instructions in this section will teach you how to construct an \\n\\n', 'Find a suitable location.:  Hydroponics systems are only suitable for indoor or greenhouse environments. They require precise control to function properly, so they should be set up somewhere closed off from other rooms and from the outside. This allows you to set the temperature and humidity to accurate levels needed for best growth.\\n\\nIt is possible to grow hydroponics using natural light, but keep the system under a glass or polyethylene covering such as a greenhouse roof, not open to the air.\\n', 'Fill a large, plastic container with water to use as a reservoir.:  Use a plastic container that does not let in any light to prevent the growth of algae. The larger this reservoir, the more stable and successful your hydroponics system will be. Each tomato plant requires about 2.5 gallons of nutrient solution.\\nYou may use a plastic bucket or trash can for this purpose. Use a brand-new one to prevent any contamination of the system, or at least a lightly-used one thoroughly scrubbed with soapy water and rinsed.\\nCollected rainwater may be better suited for hydroponics than tap water, especially if your tap water is especially \"hard\" with high mineral content.\\n', 'Fix a tray in place above the reservoir.:  This \"ebb and flow tray\" will support your tomato plants, and will be periodically flooded with nutrients and water that the tomato roots will absorb. It must be sturdy enough to hold up your plants (or be placed atop additional support), and placed higher than your reservoir to allow excess water to drain down into it. These are typically built of plastics, not metal, to avoid corrosion that could affect the plants and wear out the tray.\\n\\n', 'Install a water pump inside the reservoir.:  You can purchase a water pump at a hydroponics store, or use a fountain pump found at home improvement stores. Many pumps will have a chart listing the water flow at different heights. You may use this to find a pump strong enough to send water from the reservoir to the tray containing the plants. The best course of action, however, may be to pick a powerful, adjustable pump and experiment with the settings once you have your system set up.\\n\\n', 'Install fill tubing between the reservoir and the tray.:  Using 1\/2 inch (1.25 cm) PVC tubing, or the type of tubing that came in your hydroponics kit, attach one length of tubing between the water pump and the tray, so the tray can be flooded to the height of the tomato plant roots.\\n\\nPosition the inlet and outlet pipes at opposite ends of the tray to promote water circulation.\\n', 'Install an overflow fitting leading back to the reservoir.:  Attach a second length of PVC tubing to the tray with an overflow fitting, located at a height at the bottom of the roots.\\nKeep in mind that the overflow tube should be larger in diameter than the inlet tube from the pump to avoid flooding.\\n', \"Attach a timer to the water pump.:  A simple timer intended for light fixtures can be used to power the water pump at regular intervals.

Flooring is especially susceptible in areas with heavy foot traffic, or when you move furniture, such as chairs, across the flooring on a regular basis. In some cases, humid weather or the toenails of your pets can also damage laminate flooring. You can protect your laminate flooring with items like rugs and pads, with proper cleaning, and with other modifications.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Attach protector pads to the bottom of furniture.:  Furniture tends to move slightly across flooring with daily use. Pads will help prevent the bottom of your furniture or other sharp parts from scraping or scratching against your laminate flooring. You can purchase pads made out of several different types of materials, like felt, plastic, carpet, and cane. You can purchase protector pads from most home improvement and flooring stores.\\nPurchase protector pads, or discs, with adhesive on one side that you can stick to the bottom of your furniture.\\nPeriodically examine the felt protector pads you attached. The pads may need to be replaced when the felt becomes compressed due to regular wear of the furniture.\\n', 'Put carpets or rugs on your laminate flooring.:  \u201cLanes\u201d can often form in areas of laminate flooring that are often used. Rugs or carpets can be placed in areas with heavy foot traffic to avoid this problem. You can place rugs under furniture to prevent scratches and scrapes from marring the laminate flooring, too. Rugs can also be placed in areas that are likely to come into contact with water, like under the kitchen sink.\\n\\nPlace rubber or non-slip pads beneath your rugs in heavy foot traffic areas to prevent them from sliding around.\\n', 'Place entry welcome mats at doorways.:  Dirt, pebbles, and sand from shoes can easily scratch laminate flooring. Putting mats at your doorways can prevent this from happening. This will allow you, your family, or other visitors to wipe their feet before entering your home. You can also place mat at other areas in the home that are at risk of being scratched by debris\\xa0.\\nYou can enforce a rule that bans people from wearing shoes inside your home, which may help eliminate any debris that is tracked onto the laminate flooring from shoes.\\n', 'Replace plastic casters with rubber wheels.:  Chairs are probably the most often moved pieces of furniture in the home, especially those at kitchen tables and desks. Take the plastic casters off of the chairs and replace them with rubber wheels. This will prevent scratching and damage to the floor.\\nMake sure to buy soft rubber wheels. You can buy this online from websites like castercity.com, and from many home improvement and office stores.\\n', 'Lift furniture instead of dragging it.:  Do not drag or push furniture across the floor when you move it around. Instead, lift the furniture if possible. Lifting your furniture will prevent the scratches and scuff-marks that can be caused by dragging your furniture. If the furniture can\u2019t be lifted, it is also an option to place slide it across the floor with something underneath it.\\n\\nDo not do any lifting on your own if you feel that the furniture is too heavy. Ask a friend or family member for help.\\n', 'Slide heavy furniture across the floor.:  If you have difficulty moving large or heavy pieces of furniture, place plastic discs with padding on one side (also known as furniture sliders or moving discs) underneath your furniture. These discs will allow large and heavy furniture to glide across the laminate flooring without causing damage. Soft, thick towels or heavy blankets can also be placed underneath heavy or large furniture as an alternative to plastic discs.\\n\\nAsk friends or family to help you with lifting furniture that is too large or heavy for you to move by yourself.\\n', 'Keep the humidity levels in your home between 35 and 65 percent.:  This will prevent your laminate flooring from warping due to the expansion or contraction of the laminate flooring materials. Use a humidistat to measure the humidity levels in your home. You may already have a humidistat built into your thermostat or humidifier, or you can purchase one from a retail store that specializes in home repair.\\n\\nUse a humidifier during dry conditions to prevent your laminate flooring from shrinking, and use an air conditioner or dehumidifier in wet conditions to prevent your flooring from expanding.\\n', \"Keep the nails of your pets trimmed.:  Long nails on your pet can cause extra damage to the floor. Make sure to keep your pet\u2019s nails trimmed, but do not cut them so low that it injures the animal. Take your pet to a groomer, or trim your pet's nails using nail clippers designed for use on pets.\\n\\n\\nYou should also check the pet\u2019s paws when they come from outside to inside and remove any dirt and\/or gravel.\\n\", 'Avoid wet mopping.:  Wet mopping will cause extra water to seep into the floor, which will damage it over time. Mopping with water should also be avoided because soap and detergent based cleaners used with wet mopping damages laminate. Instead, purchase a spray on cleaner specially made for laminate floors and wipe the floors with a cloth, or use a dry mop.\\n\\nManufacturers of laminate flooring will often put out their own brands of cleaning products. It is best to use what is specifically made for your type of flooring.\\nGeneric brands are sold at supermarkets and flooring stores. Generic brands are typically okay to use, though you should test it on a small spot of your floor first.\\n', 'Clean spills from the laminate flooring as soon as they occur.:  This will prevent liquids from entering any cracks or joints in your flooring, which can eventually weaken your laminate flooring or cause it to warp. Use a soft cloth or mop to clean up spills instead of an abrasive sponge or other material that can scratch your flooring. Clean it up with the cloth alone, or with a cleaning product recommended by the manufacturer of your flooring if possible.\\n\\nIf you are required to use a cleaning product other than water to clean up spills and can\u2019t find a product made by your manufacturer, use a commercial window cleaner that does not contain ammonia. Ammonia contains properties that may strip away the protective sealant from the laminate flooring.\\n', 'Don\u2019t use a vacuum with rotary brush heads.:  Do not use a vacuum with a rotary brush or beater bar head on laminate floors. These types of heads can damage the flooring. Instead, use a felt or brush type vacuum. Before vacuuming, check to make sure the wheels are clean and haven\u2019t collected any dirt or grit.\\n\\nVacuum and sweep daily to minimize the amount of dirt and grit on the floors.\\n', 'Make repairs quickly.:  You can repair minor damage on your own by purchasing a repair kit made specifically for laminate floors. Kits will typically be made up of silicon filler and wax sticks. More extensive damage may require a replacement of tiles or planks. It is best to seek a professional for extensive damage that will require replacement.\\n\\nCompanies like Precision, Liberon, and Picobello offer laminate repair kits.\\nYou can buy repair kits at home improvement stores and online from websites such as Amazon.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Adhesive felt protector pads', 'Nail clippers for pets', 'Cleaner without a soap or detergent base', 'Plastic furniture sliders', 'Soft cloth or mop', 'Humidistat', 'Entry mat']}","extracted_answer":"laminate flooring can be susceptible to scratches","question_type":"['confirmation']","text_question":"Are laminated floors particularly vulnerable to stains and scratches?","question_id":"diy-124-0","intent_question":"ask_question_ingredients_tools","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-127","question":"I will water the spores as instructed, is there anything else I should do?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Grow-a-Rabbit-Foot-Fern","data_split":"test","original_answer":"Just be careful not to overwater them or they may rot.

By knowing how to plant, water, and care for your rabbit foot fern, you can have a happy and healthy houseplant.\\n\\n\", 'steps': ['Purchase a rabbit foot fern plant.:  Because rabbit foot ferns do not grow from seeds, but instead are propagated by dividing rhizomes or collecting spores, you must buy an existing plant. Your fern can still be a young plant when you buy it.\\nChoose a plant that looks vibrant, green, and healthy. If you notice any brown or wilting leaves, pick out a different plant.\\n', 'Plant the rabbit foot fern in a hanging basket.:  Since the rhizomes hang over the sides of the container and can grow up to 2 feet (0.61\\xa0m) long, the rabbit foot fern is ideal for a hanging basket.\\nPlastic containers tend to allow for a more even distribution of water than clay pots, but clay pots are sturdier and may last longer.\\n', 'Grow the fern in porous soil that drains well.:  You can find a porous soil mix at your local gardening store. A great soil mix should contain 2 parts peat moss, 1 part loam, and 1 part sand or perlite, which is a volcanic glass with a high water content. The soil should have a neutral pH of 6.6 to 7.5.\\nFill your container about 3 inches (7.6\\xa0cm) from the top with soil mix.\\nSoil that doesn\u2019t drain well will hold too much moisture and cause the plant to rot.\\n', 'Plant rhizomes near the top of the soil.:  Rabbit foot ferns have shallow root systems. When you plant your fern in its container, make sure to not plant it too deeply. Keep the rhizomes at the surface of the soil so they don\u2019t rot.\\n', \"Place the rabbit foot fern in indirect light.:  During the winter months in the northern hemisphere, a north-facing window is an ideal location for the fern. During the spring and summer months, when the sun is higher on the horizon, choose an east-facing window with filtered light.\\n\\nAvoid south- and west-facing windows where the direct sunlight may burn the fern's leaves.\\n\", \"Water the fern sparingly.:  Allow the soil in the container to dry out slightly between waterings. When the soil is dry or almost dry to the touch, it's time to water. Over-watering will cause the leaves to yellow and may result in root rot.\\nMist the fuzzy rhizomes regularly. Give them water every few days, or as needed, to prevent them from drying out.\\n\", \"Grow the fern in a moderately humid environment.:  If your heat is on in your home during winter months, consider using a room humidifier where your rabbit foot fern is located.\\n\\nIf you don't have a room humidifier, place the fern's container on a tray of wet pebbles to increase the humidity around the plant. Refill the tray as the water evaporates.\\n\", 'Maintain a 60\u201375\\xa0\u00b0F (16\u201324\\xa0\u00b0C) environment.:  The rabbit foot fern will thrive indoors in comfortable house temperatures.

","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Paint Concrete Statues', 'description': '\\nConcrete statues are commonly found as yard ornaments or objects of interior d\u00e9cor. Because concrete is porous, it is important to clean it, apply a base coat, paint it, and seal it to make the beauty last. When well-cared for, your concrete statuary can be eye-catching and unique.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Put the statue in a bucket of plain water and scrub it with a large brush.:  Don\u2019t use soap in the water since it may have a negative effect on the concrete and the overall painting process. Scrub the statue until you get the large areas as clean as you\u2019d like them. Use a toothbrush to scrub the smaller nooks and crannies in the statue.\\n', 'Take the statue out of the bucket and let it dry in the sun.:  It should take a few minutes to dry, depending on how warm the air is. Air drying the statue will kill any moss that\u2019s left behind. Concrete statues look more pristine when they\u2019ve been dried in the sun and when they don\u2019t have any moss on their surfaces.\\nDon\u2019t leave concrete statuary to dry outside in the winter, because moisture will collect in its pores, causing it to expand and eventually crack.\\n', 'Fill in cracks with epoxy putty.:  Choose a putty that is the same color as the statue, or close enough. So, if the statue is white or gray use silver or gray putty. Break off a couple pieces of epoxy putty or however many you need to fill in each crack. Smooth it over using a wet spatula or a knife and let the putty dry for 3 to 4 hours. \\nYou can find epoxy putty in craft stores.\\nWear gloves when handling epoxy putty to protect your skin from irritation.\\nUse a blow dryer to set the putty quickly.\\nYou can use epoxy putty to replace missing pieces from a concrete statue, such as toes. The putty becomes hard as a rock once it\u2019s dried, so no one will know a toe was ever missing.\\n', 'Dump water on the statue to make the paint stain the concrete.:  Before applying a base coat getting the statue wet will ensure that that paint stains it under the surface, rather than just coating the surface. Concrete is porous, so the water will pull the paint further in to make the base coat more permanent.\\nHave a container of clean water ready for drenching the statue. There is no set recommended amount of water to use on the statue, as long as it\u2019s soaked through.\\n', 'Mix water with your acrylic base coat to ensure it\u2019s absorbed well.:  It doesn\u2019t hurt to add water to the actual paint, because this will help it to soak into the concrete. When you water down a basecoat, the concrete absorbs it and stains better.\\nThere is no recommended ratio of water to use.\\nIf you plan to use an antiquing or detailing method on the statue, choose white paint for the base coat.\\n', 'Coat the bottom of the concrete statue with the base coat first.:  You should paint the bottom first, because you would leave finger smudges in the paint on the top of the statue if you painted the bottom last. Place it on its side to let the bottom dry.\\n\\nThis should be the same paint that you\u2019re using as the base coat for the rest of the statue.\\n', 'Apply a base coat to the entire statue using a 2\\xa0in (5.1\\xa0cm) chip brush.:  Use an acrylic latex exterior paint for the base coat. The paint can be any color, but popular base coats are black, gray, and brown.\\n', 'Inspect the statue after letting the basecoat dry for 5 minutes.:  Feel it with your hand for wet paint. If it\u2019s completely dry, then it\u2019s ready for the top coat. On a warm day the paint may dry in 5 minutes. It may take a little more time on a humid day.\\nKeep the wet statue away from pets and children who may tamper with it.\\n', 'Use acrylic latex paint on concrete statues.:  For concrete statuary, water-based acrylic latex paints are recommended for their ability to soak into the concrete and stain it beyond its surface. Acrylic latex paints also don\u2019t dry and crack like a shell over time, like oil-based paint does.\\nIf you\u2019re painting an animal, you may choose realistic colors, such as brown and white for a rabbit.\\nYou should always use a paintbrush to paint the statue, as opposed to spray painting it. Spray paint doesn\u2019t look as nice and it doesn\u2019t last as long as paint applied with a brush.\\n', 'Paint the top coat using the dry-brush method.:  Dip a 2\\xa0in (5.1\\xa0cm) chip paintbrush into the color you chose as the top coat. Wipe most of the paint off on a piece of cardboard so that there\u2019s almost no paint left on the bristles. With the brush almost dry, paint against the details of the statue using a back-and-forth dusting motion.\\nMake furry animal statues stand out by painting them with a base coat, and then dry-brushing a solid color over it. For example, dry-brush brown paint over a black base. Soften the brown with some white paint dusted over it.\\n', 'Give the statue a weathered effect by antiquing it, if desired.:  After applying the top coat, wipe away the excess paint using a paper towel. Apply and wipe away paint as necessary to get the desired effect. A small amount of the base coat should be exposed throughout the statue to make the color look faded.\\nConcrete leaf stepping stones are an example of statues that look good with an antiquing method.\\n', 'Leave the top coat to dry for 24 hours.:  Allow the top coat to dry for 24 hours before moving on to the next step in painting concrete. Let it sit outside if it\u2019s warm and dry out.\\n', 'Highlight a statue\u2019s features with the detailing technique.:  Detailing involves using small brushes to create details in the top coat by hand and using multiple colors of paint. Use this technique to fill in features such as eyes, noses, and clothes on statues. Detailing can be used when you\u2019re painting animal statues with feathers and beaks or gnomes with clothes, for instance.\\n\\nOne example is if you\u2019re painting a manatee statue and want to give it some pink coloring on its cheeks; use a small brush and give its cheeks a dusting of pink paint.\\n', 'Cover the statue with a UV\/water sealant to protect the paint from the elements.:  Place the concrete statue on a ventilated surface, such as gravel or rock, when you apply the sealant. Leave it there for 24 hours to dry. Sealants make paint last longer and prevent it from flaking off. Sealants come as sprays and in the form of a paint. They protect paint colors from fading and repel harmful moisture.\\nYou can also buy a can of clear enamel spray to make the statue look glossy.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"leave the top coat to dry for 24 hours","question_type":"['confirmation']","text_question":"Is there anything I can do to speed up the drying process?","question_id":"diy-129-7","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_external_fact"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-131","question":"Am I really supposed to be cutting and digging the bamboo for the next few years until the plant stops sending up shoots?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Kill-Bamboo","data_split":"test","original_answer":"If the bamboo starts to grow again and reaches a certain size then you will have to cut and dig repeatedly (especially if you don't want to use herbicides).

With the right pruning techniques, your ficus tree's foliage will look fuller and more appealing.\\n\\n\", 'steps': [\"Trim outdoor ficuses anytime in late summer, fall, or spring.:  Outdoor ficuses are fairly adaptable and can be trimmed during most seasons. Anytime from late summer to early spring is ideal, as this is right before and after your ficus's dormant season.\\nTry not to prune your outdoor tree in early summer, as this can induce an off-season growth spurt and leave your plant more vulnerable to frost.\\n\", 'Prune indoor ficuses in summer, autumn, or early spring.:  Indoor ficuses need regular pruning to remove old leaves and shape the plant to its living space. Avoid pruning your indoor ficus in mid-spring, however, particularly when it is forming new leaves and buds.\\n', \"Shape ficuses in winter.:  For extensive shaping, wait until your plant's dormant season in winter. Your plant is least likely to sustain shock from pruning and, with outdoor plants, you'll be able to see the branch structure better.\\n\", 'Prune away diseased, broken, or dead branches anytime.:  Dying or dead branches can weaken your tree and make it vulnerable to further damage. To prevent this from happening, remove damaged branches as you notice them.\\nIf your tree is weak, avoid pruning beyond from trimming or cutting away damaged areas.\\n', \"Prune your ficus in the spring if you want it to grow fuller.:  If you've noticed excessively thin areas on your ficus, pruning can encourage branching. Try trimming your ficus in early springtime to encourage branch and foliage growth during the next season.\\n\\nIf you've noticed thinning in summer or early fall, wait until the following season to prune for this reason.\\n\", \"Put on gardening gloves before handling your ficus.:  Most ficus varieties excrete a toxic milky sap that causes skin irritation. To prevent rashes, wear thick gloves while pruning your ficus.\\nGloves made with latex or thin fabrics will not protect your skin from the ficus's sap. You can find thick gardening gloves at most plant nurseries or garden centers.\\n\", 'Inspect your tree for dying or dead branches.:  If you notice diseased, damaged, or dead branches, prune them away at a downward slant with your loppers or shears. Cut the damaged branch back to a healthy area to help your tree heal and focus its energy on healthy branches.\\nDying or dead branches usually lose their bark and have grey or decaying wood.\\n', \"Prune above leaf scars to encourage fuller growth.:  If your ficus tree has thinned out more than usual, inspect your ficus for scars where leaves used to be. Clip directly above leaf scars to encourage thicker foliage as your plant grows.\\n\\nLeaf scars are small, round marks found where your plant originally grew leaves. They're usually lighter in color than the surrounding branch.\\nPruning above leaf scars should ideally be done in spring.\\n\", 'Put cut paste on extensively pruned areas.:  If you prune back large branches or make many cuts, apply cut paste over the clipped area. Because pruning is like making many small wounds on a plant, cut paste will help your tree heal and protect it from diseases and pests while it recovers.\\n\\nYou can buy cut paste online or at most plant nurseries.\\n', \"Discard ficus clippings immediately after pruning.:  Because ficus plants are toxic, their clippings cannot be used as a mulch or compost. Collect the clippings in a trash bag and discard them when you're done pruning.\\nFor an environmentally-friendly alternative, ask local recycling centers if they can make use of your ficus clippings.\\n\", \"Don't prune more than 30% of your ficus at a time.:  Too much pruning can throw your tree into shock and leave it vulnerable to diseases.

When shaping your tree, keep your tree's initial shape in mind and aim for a trimmer, better maintained version of its original pattern.\\n\\nFicus trees are usually round and widest at the bottom.\\n\", \"Thin out any overgrown areas.:  Inspect your tree for branches that jut from the plant's natural shape or overlap other branches. Cut away these overgrown branches with shears or loppers, depending on the branch size, directly above a node or where another stem branches off to minimize damage.\\nThinning out your ficus's foliage helps light penetrate the tree, which can make the plant look fuller and give it better air flow.\\n\", 'Prune away vertical branches.:  Vertical branches can give your tree a bulky, awkward shape. Inspect your tree for any branches growing upward and cut them back using your loppers or shears. \\n\\n', \"Avoid removing lower branches or leaves.:  The lower leaves and branches bring essential nutrients to the trunk, and a strong trunk is essential for holding up the ficus's foliage. Thin or shape the lower branches lightly to keep your tree strong.\\n\\nThis is especially true for smaller ficus trees like rubber trees and fiddle leaf figs.\\n\", \"Transplant or repot your ficus if it grows too large.:  If you've cut back about 30% of your ficus and it is still too large for its pot or your backyard, try \\nAvoid transplanting trees with a trunk diameter wider than 2 inches (5.1\\xa0cm).

Then fill the spray bottle up until until about one inch (2.54 cm) from the top with warm water.\\nUse either peppermint, tea tree, citrus, lavender or neem essential oil, as these oils are proven to repel spiders.\\nTry to use a glass spray bottle, as essential oils can sometimes react with plastic.\\n', 'Add dish soap and shake.:  Add a small squirt of liquid dish soap into the spray bottle, then place the top on the bottle and shake so that the mixture is combined.\\nBecause oil and water don\u2019t mix, dish soap is needed to break apart the oil molecules so that they can mix in with the water.\\n', 'Spray on entry points.:  Spray the essential oil spray on any entry points in your house, including around window frames, door cracks, and any crevices that you may notice in your home. Also spray any corners where spiders tend to congregate.\\nIf you are spraying furniture or carpets, keep in mind that the oil may leave a stain. Spot test an inconspicuous area of the upholstery or carpet by spraying and making sure the repellent doesn\u2019t alter its color before using.\\n', 'Reapply the spray once a week.:  Natural repellents need to be reapplied more often than chemical-based ones, so make sure that you reapply the spray once a week.\\n', 'Make an ammonia repellent.:  Combine 1 part ammonia and 1 part water in a spray bottle, then close the spray bottle and shake. Spray the ammonia spray around entry points in your house and other places where spiders tend to gather. Reapply the spray every week. \\n\\nInstead of making a spray, you can also dip a cloth in the solution and use it to wipe around the entry points of your house for a more concentrated application.\\n', 'Make a vinegar spray.:  Combine one part vinegar to two parts water in a spray bottle and shake to mix. Spray the vinegar spray around doorways, window frames, or other points of entry in your house, reapplying the spray every week for the best results.\\n', 'Make a saltwater spray.:  Pour half an ounce (14.78 ml) of salt into a half gallon (1.89 liters) of warm water and mix until the salt is dissolved. Then pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Use the spray on points of entry to deter spiders, reapplying the spray once a week.\\nSpraying salt water directly on a spider can kill it.\\n', 'Create a tobacco spray.:  Fill a spray bottle almost to the top with hot water, then add a healthy pinch of tobacco. Allow the tobacco to soak into and infuse the water for about an hour, then spray the mixture around the entry points of your home. The strong smell of the tobacco will drive away unwanted spiders.\\n', 'Sprinkle cedar shavings.:  Place a sprinkling of cedar shavings or several blocks of cedar around points of entry and spider-infested areas. You can also lay down cedar mulch in your garden or around the perimeter of your house. The strong smell of cedar will deter spiders and drive them away.\\n', 'Use diatomaceous earth.:  Sprinkle 100% food-grade diatomaceous earth lightly on points of entry around your home, such as around window sills and doors. Keep in mind that diatomaceous earth will \\nDiatomaceous earth is picked up on spiders\u2019 legs and lower bodies and works by slowly dehydrating the spiders until they die.\\nThough diatomaceous earth kills spiders and insects, it is safe for you and your pets.\\n', 'Use baking soda.:  Sprinkle baking soda around your house in points of entry or around the areas where you notice the most spiders. The smell of baking soda will drive the spiders away from your home.\\n', 'Line entry points with chestnuts.:  Place unshelled chestnuts around the various points of entry in your home and areas favored by spiders. Though there is some controversy around the effectiveness of using chestnuts as repellent, with some calling it an old wives tale, others swear by them!\\n', 'Rub entry points with citrus.:  Rub entry points of your home such as windowsills, doorways and cracks with citrus peels. You can even scatter citrus peels around your home in inconspicuous places to strengthen the effect of this deterrent.\\n', 'Sprinkle tobacco around your home.:  Because spiders hate the scent of tobacco, you can sprinkle small bits of tobacco around your home to drive away pesky spiders.\\n', 'Use herbs and spices.:  Scatter bay leaves, whole cloves, turmeric, or ground black pepper around the exterior of your house or around entry points inside your home to drive away spiders.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Essential oils (citrus, lavender, peppermint, tea tree or neem oil)', 'Dish soap', 'Ammonia', 'Tobacco', 'Salt', 'Cedar shavings', 'Diatomaceous earth', 'Cedar shavings or blocks', 'Baking soda', 'Chestnuts', 'Citrus peels', 'Bay leaves', 'Cloves', 'Turmeric', 'Ground black pepper']}","extracted_answer":"sprinkle baking soda around your house","question_type":"['confirmation']","text_question":"Should I just sprinkle the baking soda too?","question_id":"diy-140-5","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_external_fact"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-142","question":"Can i plant two or more seeds in each planting pot?

You can grow your roses best with a food balance that\u2019s high in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as some secondary nutrients and minerals. Natural fertilizers provide steady nutrients to the soil long-term, and there are many types to choose from. Chemical fertilizers are fast-acting and need only 1-3 applications for the year. Many rose gardeners prefer to combine the two types of fertilizer for the best results.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Use natural fertilizers before planting and before your rose\u2019s first bloom.:  For new and small rose plants, it\u2019s best to use organic fertilizers to avoid burning their delicate roots. Add nutrients to the soil before planting your rose bush, and after you first plant them, with natural fertilizers. Wait until after they bloom the first time before using any chemical fertilizers.\\nIn early spring, before roses come out of dormancy and start to bloom, using natural fertilizers is the best way to get roses accustomed to new nutrients in the soil.\\nLook for fertilizers labeled organic at a local garden supply store, or use the recipes in the homemade fertilizers section.\\n', 'Apply natural fertilizers every 4 weeks during high growth season.:  To keep a steady amount of nutrients flowing into your roses\u2019 soil, use natural fertilizers every 4 weeks from early spring until 3-4 weeks before they enter dormancy. Work whatever fertilizer you choose into the upper soil levels.\\nSpread solid or granular natural fertilizers in a circle around the top of the soil about 6\\xa0in (15\\xa0cm) from the base of the bush and work it into the top 2\\xa0in (5.1\\xa0cm) of soil with a small cultivator.\\nLiquid natural fertilizers can be poured in a circle about 6\\xa0in (15\\xa0cm) from the base of the bush.\\n', 'Stop all fertilization 35-40 days before the first frost date.:  Applying fertilizers too late in the growing season could cause young, soft growth that\u2019s easily damaged by the first frost. To encourage your roses to begin preparing for winter dormancy, stop fertilizing them 35-40 days, or 6-8 weeks, before the first frost.\\nIn many areas, this will be around mid-August. Use the first frost prediction for your exact region to be sure.\\n', 'Try a blend of Epsom salt with bone, cottonseed, blood, and fish meal to start.:  A popular early spring natural fertilizer recipe can be made by combining 4\\xa0oz (110\\xa0g) Epsom salt, 8\\xa0oz (230\\xa0g) bone meal, 8\\xa0oz (230\\xa0g) cottonseed meal, 4\\xa0oz (110\\xa0g) blood meal, and 4\\xa0oz (110\\xa0g) fish meal. Water your bush thoroughly first, spread the mixture around the base of the plant below its outer perimeter, and work the mixture into the top 2\\xa0in (5.1\\xa0cm) of soil with a cultivator until it\u2019s buried.\\nWater your bush thoroughly again after working the fertilizer into the soil.\\nYou can find these ingredients at nurseries and garden supply stores that sell natural or organic fertilizers.\\n', 'Use alfalfa pellets or tea to add many nutrients to your soil.:  Another natural fertilizer method uses alfalfa pellets. You can use non-food grade ones, sold at garden supply stores, or rabbit food alfalfa pellets. Spread 8\u201312\\xa0oz (230\u2013340\\xa0g) of the pellets over the soil under your bush\u2019s outer perimeter, and work it into the top 2\\xa0in (5.1\\xa0cm) of soil.\\nAn alternative is to make alfalfa tea.

Let the mixture sit covered for 3-5 days and stir it once per day, then strain any remaining solids from the water. Water your roses with the tea every 4 weeks during growing season.\\n', 'Bury banana peels to replenish potassium.:  To use banana peels, you can either bury them and let them compost before planting your roses, or bury them 4\u20136\\xa0in (10\u201315\\xa0cm) deep under the outer perimeter of your rose bush. They will \\nThis method is best used in conjunction with another natural method, like coffee grounds or alfalfa pellets.\\nGrind the banana peels in a blender or chop them into fine pieces to promote faster composting.\\n', 'Try coffee grounds for adding nitrogen and potassium.:  Spread 48\\xa0oz (1,400\\xa0g) of used coffee grounds on a cookie sheet lined with newspaper. Allow them to dry completely, then sprinkle them around the outer perimeter of your rose bush then water it thoroughly.\\nMake a liquid solution of this fertilizer by soaking 48\\xa0oz (1,400\\xa0g) coffee grounds in 5 gallons (19\\xa0L) of water for 2-3 days. Then saturate the soil around the bush in place of watering it one day.\\n', 'Make a grass and weed clippings solution to enhance your soil.:  Grass and weeds soak up nutrients from the soil that can be reused as fertilizer. Fill a 5 gallons (19\\xa0L) bucket with grass clippings and weeds like nettles, horsetail, and chickweed and add water to the full bucket until it\u2019s full of grass, weeds, and water.

You can grow your roses best with a food balance that\u2019s high in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as some secondary nutrients and minerals. Natural fertilizers provide steady nutrients to the soil long-term, and there are many types to choose from. Chemical fertilizers are fast-acting and need only 1-3 applications for the year. Many rose gardeners prefer to combine the two types of fertilizer for the best results.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Use natural fertilizers before planting and before your rose\u2019s first bloom.:  For new and small rose plants, it\u2019s best to use organic fertilizers to avoid burning their delicate roots. Add nutrients to the soil before planting your rose bush, and after you first plant them, with natural fertilizers. Wait until after they bloom the first time before using any chemical fertilizers.\\nIn early spring, before roses come out of dormancy and start to bloom, using natural fertilizers is the best way to get roses accustomed to new nutrients in the soil.\\nLook for fertilizers labeled organic at a local garden supply store, or use the recipes in the homemade fertilizers section.\\n', 'Apply natural fertilizers every 4 weeks during high growth season.:  To keep a steady amount of nutrients flowing into your roses\u2019 soil, use natural fertilizers every 4 weeks from early spring until 3-4 weeks before they enter dormancy.

Technically speaking, climbing roses are not a specific rose breed. The term includes any rose variety that grows until a large, sprawling bush. Climbing roses are large shrubs that will grow out of control if left alone, but by training them along a trellis, you can get them to \"climb\" in an orderly fashion.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Plant the roses in spring.:  Planting the climbing roses earlier in the season gives them ample opportunity to establish a sturdy root system before winter. You can technically plant them in the early fall, as well, but roses planted in the fall may not be as strong the following season.\\n\\n', 'Choose an appropriate location.:  Roses generally prefer full sun, so the spot you plant them in should receive an average of at least six hours of sun per day. A spot that receives early morning sun from the east is generally better than one that gets hot afternoon sun from the west.\\nChoose a spot with plenty of space. Climbing roses tend to overtake the space that they grow in, so they should be positioned away from trees, shrubs, and other plants.\\nSoil near walls and fences tends to be dry and low-quality. If you want to plant the rose within 1 foot (30 cm) of one, replace the soil with an even mix of quality topsoil and well-rotted compost or manure.\\n', 'Replace soil if previously used to grow roses.:  Roses suffer from \"replant disease,\" meaning they may struggle or die if planted in soil where another rose plant grew.\\nYou may use the displaced topsoil to grow any plant besides roses.\\n', 'Add amendment to the soil.:  Roses need light, well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Chop the soil in the plant bed up using a trowel or shovel and mix several handfuls of compost into the soil. Mix enough in that \u2153 to \u00bd of the plant bed consists of organic material.\\n\\nSkip this step if you already replaced the soil.\\n', 'Prepare the roots of a bare root rose.:  Climbing roses are often planted as bare root plants, without any container or ball of dirt. Before planting a bare root rose, soak in a bucket of lukewarm water for about an hour. Remove any leaves or hips from the stems, and prune long or damaged roots.\\n\\n\\n', 'Dig a hole large enough for the roots to spread out in.:  A good rule of thumb is to make the hole about twice as wide as the actual plant. Usually, this means that the hole needs to be about 18 inches (46 cm) wide and 12 inches (31 cm) deep.\\n\\n', 'Form a small mound in the middle of the hole.:  Scrape soil from inside the hole to form a small bump or hill.\\n\\nSome rose growers like to sprinkle rose fertilizer, bone meal, or other nutrients at the base of the hole. Do not use fertilizer on plants with young roots, as it can burn them. Other soil improvements should be based on the specific qualities of your soil.\\n', 'Place the rose plant in the hole.:  Sit the plant on the peak of the mound and carefully spread the roots out down the sides of the mound. (If your plant has a root ball, just spread out the roots growing around the outside.) Check the location of the graft union \u2014 the knot or ball where the root system was attached to the base of the trunk. Lay a tool handle flat from the edge of the hole to the trunk, and compare this with the level of the graft union:\\n\\nIf you have dense or clay-heavy soil, plant the graft union about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the soil surface to prevent rotting. Adjust the height of the mound as necessary.\\nIf you have light, loamy soil, plant the graft 1 inch (2.5 cm) below ground level.\\n', 'Water thoroughly.:  Fill the hole to the brim with water and let drain. Keep an eye on the water level. Continue to the next step as soon as it finishes draining, to prevent the roots drying out.\\n\\n', \"Fill the hole with soil.:  Add soil back in the hole, until the roots are fully covered and the soil is level. As you fill, tamp down with your hands gently. Do not tamp with your feet or tools, as densely packed soil could harm the roots or interfere with the rose's growth.\\n\\nPay special attention to tamping early on. Make sure there are no air pockets around the roots.\\nMake sure the crown of the plant is above the soil level. The crown is the point on the trunk where the stems emerge.\\n\", 'Make sure that the roses get enough water.:  Roses require about 1\" of rain each week, so make sure that you supplement their water needs if the rain isn\\'t falling. Water them at the base of the plant near the soil.\\n\\n', \"Avoid watering the leaves and blooms.:  While you can't control where the rainfall lands, if you add water to your plants make sure that you're avoiding buds and leaves. Otherwise, your plant may suffer diseases and rot, which can result from water. Instead, focus your watering on the roots.\\n\\n\", 'Check the soil 2-3 times a week.:  To make sure that your soil is moist but not soggy, check it 2-3 times a week. If it feels dry, add water. Allowing the roots to get too wet can harm your plant, so if your soil has been soggy, give it time to dry before adding more water.\\n\\n', 'Add mulch to your soil.:  Place a 2-4-inch (5-10 cm) layer of mulch around your rose plants. The mulch will help keep your plants moist, and as a bonus it will also help protect against weed growth. During the winter, mulch can also help keep your roses from freezing.\\n\\n', 'Choose the right climbing structure.:  Climbing roses tend to be fairly heavy, so you will need more than a pole to support them. Consider using a rose tower or teepee trellis, using the process described in the steps below. Alternatively, use existing structures:\\n\\nYou may grow roses on a pergola or gazebo.\\nRoses can grow up walls or fences, but the lack of air circulation can cause issues. Using a trellis or horizontal wires near the wall is recommended.\\nRoses can be convinced to climb up a tree, but they will not cling to it on their own. Try tying sturdy string onto the lowest tree branch and anchoring it in the ground next to the rose.\\n', 'Position the trellis in the ground.:  Place the trellis about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) away from the roses. If planting the roses near a wall or fence, do not lean the trellis directly against the structure. Instead, allow for at least 3 inches (7.5 cm) of space in between the trellis and the wall to give the roses plenty of air circulation.\\n\\n', 'Install the trellis in the ground.:  You can often install the trellis simply by pushing its legs about 4 inches (10 cm) into the ground. If the soil is hard, dig a hole for each leg of the trellis instead. Pack soil back into the holes firmly to keep the trellis anchored.\\n\\n', 'Attach the rose canes to the trellis.:  The smaller stems that carry the flowers are called rose canes. Attach these canes to the trellis as the rose bush grows tall enough to reach the bars. Choose the strongest canes and loosely tie them to the trellis using stretchy cloth, such as nylon or pantyhose.\\n', 'Avoid major pruning for several years.:  Other than removing dead branches, leave the rose shrub alone for two or three years. After that time, you can begin pruning side shoots down to two or three buds every winter, when the plant is dormant.\\n\\nWhen you are ready to prune your roses, you need to follow a specific process. Make a 45 degree cut about 1\/4-inch (6 mm) above a leaf node. Be sure to angle your cut away from the leaf node so that any water on the plant runs away from the node instead of towards it.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Climbing rose plant', 'Compost', 'Trowel or shovel', 'Watering can or garden hose', 'Trellis']}","extracted_answer":"soak in a bucket of lukewarm water for about an hour","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"How long do I need to soak the roots for?","question_id":"diy-146-7","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"return_next_step"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-147","question":"Where could I get potassium?

To keep your garden green and maximize your yield, add potassium when your plants start to flower or if you spot yellowing. In addition, testing your soil every one to two years will let you know exactly what amendments to make.\\n\\n\", 'steps': [\"Mix in muriate of potash or sulfate of potash.:  Muriate of potash, or potassium chloride, and sulfate of potash, or potassium sulfate, are natural minerals. Muriate of potash tends to be cheaper, but the chlorine it contains can hurt the helpful microbes living in your garden's soil. Sulfate of potash is safer, but it\u2019s a bit more expensive.\\nCheck your product\u2019s label for specific instructions on how much to add per square foot or meter.\\nMake sure the product you purchase is certified organic by the Organic Minerals Review Institute (OMRI).\\n\", 'Try kelp meal or seaweed.:  Kelp and other types of seaweed are rich in potassium, and quickly release it into soil. You can either mix a few handfuls of dried kelp meal into the soil or by spray it with a liquid seaweed spray.\\nMix in a pound of kelp meal per square foot of soil (about 450 grams for 9 square meters).\\n', 'Try Sul-Po-Mag.:  Also called langbeinite or sulfate of potash-magnesia, Sul-Po-Mag is your most affordable option.

Greensand releases potassium at a slow rate, so it\u2019s better for long-term soil maintenance than quick adjustments. It also works as a conditioner and helps soil retain water.\\nIn addition to digging greensand into your soil directly, you can also add it to your compost pile to improve the potassium content of your compost.\\n', 'Add granite dust.:  Granite dust is mined from natural granite quarries and is fairly inexpensive. Like greensand, it releases potassium slowly, so it won\u2019t work well if you need to make a quick fix.\\n', 'Bury banana peels in your soil.:  Cut up peels into small pieces and bury them an inch or two (4 or 5 centimeters) in your soil. The peels will take time to rot, so they\u2019ll release potassium more slowly than other amendments.\\n\\nAdding banana peels directly to your soil will also help deter aphids.\\n', \"Beef up your compost with banana peels.:  To increase your compost's potassium content, add fruit and vegetable waste to the pile. Banana peels are your best bet, but orange rinds, lemon rinds, beets, spinach, and tomatoes will make excellent additions, too.\\nKeep in mind you\u2019ll need to give your compost weeks or months to mature.\\n\", 'Keep your compost covered to prevent potassium leaching.:  Use a lidded container or cover your compost heap with a tarp when you\u2019re not using it. Potassium compounds are water soluble, so rainfall can easily wash them out of your compost.\\n', 'Have your soil tested every one to two years.:  For most gardeners, it\u2019s recommended to have your soil lab tested every two years.

When they flower and fruit, plants can deplete their potassium supply in a matter of days.\\n', 'Add potassium if you spot signs of deficiency.:  Signs of deficiency include yellow leaves and brown leaf edges. Discoloration usually occurs in older leaves first, or those closer to the bottom of your plant. In fruiting plants, like tomatoes, you might see uneven ripening or yellow patches on the fruit. \\n\\n', 'Monitor your plants more closely if you have sandy soil.:  Because of its high solubility, potassium can easily leach out of soil, especially in coarse, sandy soils. Keep a close eye on your plants if you know leaching could be an issue. If possible, test your soil more frequently.\\n\\nAmending your sandy soil with manure and well-rotted compost can help prevent leaching.\\n', 'Check for signs of magnesium deficiency.:  Adding more potassium can lower the amount of other nutrients that the plant absorbs. Potassium competes with magnesium most directly, so look for yellowing between leaves\u2019 veins. The veins themselves stay green, but the the spaces between them turn yellow.\\nIf you add potassium but notice yellowing occurs or worsens, just purchase an organic calcium-magnesium supplement or magnesium sulfate.

While it is easy to sweep and remove debris, getting out stains can be much tougher.  There are many options for cleaning your driveway such as pressure washing, using items already in your household, or chemical cleaners for those tough stains. \\n\\n', 'steps': [\"Clear out your driveway.:  Remove any loose materials, cars, dirt, or stone from your driveway.  If your driveway touches any doors or walls, cover them with cardboard, a tarp, or some painter's tape. This will protect them from any debris that may fly around while you are pressure washing.\\nCheck to see which end of your driveway is the highest and what direction the water will flow while you are washing.\\nCreate a dam to manage the drainage. It is best if your water is absorbed by your lawn. If the water drains into a storm drain, you will be introducing chemicals into your local water supply.\\n\", 'Apply a degreaser to the stain.:  Oil and antifreeze stains are the stains you will most likely have on your driveway. Before you use a pressure washer, apply a degreaser to the stain.\\nUse the degreaser at full strength for older stains that have penetrated your driveway. Dilute the degreaser with water for newer stains.\\nFollow the dilution instructions on the degreaser bottle. The dilution ratio will vary depending on the product that you use.\\nOnce you have allowed the degreaser to sit, scrub it into the stain using a wire brush.\\n', 'Set up your pressure washer.:  Typically you will use a pressure hose to connect the spray wand to the washer and connect the washer to a garden hose. The setup may vary depending on the pressure washer that you are using.  Always read the instructions before you set up the pressure washer.\\nThe pressure washer comes with both low pressure and high pressure nozzles.\\nIf your cleaning a brick driveway, do not use the high pressure nozzle at all except on very stubborn stains.\\n', 'Apply the detergent to your driveway.:   The instructions that come with your pressure washer will tell you what type of detergent you should use. Only use detergents that have been formulated to use with a pressure washer.\\nDo not allow the detergent to dry on your driveway.  If you notice that is getting dried out, apply some water to your driveway.\\nDo not add bleach to your pressure washer because the bleach may cause damage to the washer.\\nStart at the higher end of the driveway and move in the direction that water flows.\\n', 'Rinse your driveway.:   After fifteen minutes, use the high pressure nozzle to wash away the detergent. Make sure you set the pressure washer to rinse mode.  Use the same pattern you used when you were applying the detergent.\\nBe sure to wash away all of the detergent.\\nPay extra attention to the heavily stained, dirtier areas of your driveway, which may require higher pressure.\\nYou can use a surface cleaner attachment for more effective cleaning.  If you use this attachment, do a final rinse without the attachment one all of the detergent and dirt are gone.\\n', 'Apply a natural absorbent.:  Cat litter, corn starch, cornmeal, or baking soda be used to remove oil and gasoline from your driveway. Cover the stain with one of these products and allow it to sit for at least an hour. If the stain was wet when you applied the absorbent, the absorbent will soak up the oil or gasoline. Use a broom to sweep up the absorbent.\\nIf the stain was dry when you applied the absorbent, wet the stain with water and scrub it with a stiff brush and a paste (i.e. 3 parts baking soda to 1 part water). Then rinse the area with water and let it air dry.\\nYou may have to repeat this process more than once.\\n', 'Apply cola to the stain.:  Pour two cans of room temperature cola on the stain and let it sit overnight.  Blot the stain with a towel in the morning and rinse the stain with water.\\nYou can also scrub the cola into the stain with a stiff brush.\\nIf you cannot let the cola sit overnight, let it soak for at least an hour before you spray the area with water.\\n', 'Use dishwasher detergent.:  Wet the area with the stain and sprinkle dish-washing detergent  (i.e. powdered detergent) all over.  Make sure the area is completely covered with detergent.  While the detergent is sitting on the stain, boil a large pot of water.  Once the water begins to boil, pour it over the stain and scrub it with a stiff-bristled brush. Rinse the area with water once you are finished.\\nYou can use baking soda instead of dish-washing detergent.\\nRepeat this process as many times as you need to.\\n', 'Make a poultice.:  Combine an absorbent material (e.g. kitty litter or sawdust) with a solvent (e.g. acetone, xylene, or lacquer thinner) until the paste has the consistency of peanut butter.  Spread the poultice over the stained area.  It should be 1\/4 to 1\/2 inch thick. Cover the area with plastic and let it sit for approximately 24 hours.\\nThis can be an expensive option if you have a large are to cover with the poultice.\\nUse other methods before you try a poultice or any other chemical cleaner.\\nAlways wear gloves and protective eye wear if you are working with chemicals.\\n', 'Use an enzymatic cleaner.:   These cleaners are also known as oxidation cleaners. You can purchase them at your local hardware store, home-improvement store, or a janitorial supply store. These chemicals do not require much work. All you have to do is apply them to the stain and let them work.\\nNo water or scrubbing is required with these cleaners. The enzymes and\/or bacteria in the cleaner will destroy the stain.\\nAlways follow the instructions that come with the cleaner that you purchase.\\nThese cleaners usually take days or weeks to remove the stain. You may have to reapply for larger stains.\\nA cleaner like this is great for removing pet urine stains.\\n', 'Use a professional cleaner.:  If all else has failed, consult a professional cleaner to treat your driveway. A professional may use muriatic acid or some other chemicals to clean your driveway.\\nShop around for a good price before you choose a professional.\\nThis is a more expensive option, but it can save you money in the long run.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"apply the detergent to your driveway","question_type":"['navigation']","text_question":"I can't pass up an opportunity to use my pressure washer!

","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Cut Plexiglass', 'description': '\\nPlexiglass is a cheap and durable material that you can use for a variety of projects like picture frames, tabletops, or as a shatterproof substitute for glass. It is lightweight, inexpensive, and it lasts for a long time because it can\u2019t rot or crack. You can also easily cut it to shape with the right tools, the proper precautions, and correct measurements. Thin sheets can be scored and snapped with a utility knife or scoring tool. Thicker sheets will need to be cut with either a circular saw for straight lines or a jigsaw to cut shapes out of the sheet.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Lay the plexiglass flat on a work surface.:  For thin sheets of plexiglass that are up to \\nMake sure the surface is clean and clear of any objects that could impede your work or potentially mark or damage the sheet.\\nUse an even and stable structure that doesn\u2019t wobble.\\n', 'Draw a line with a dry-erase marker where you want to cut the board.:  With the sheet laid flat on the work surface, use a ruler as a guide and draw a straight line where you want to cut the sheet. Make the line visible and be careful not to smudge the marker.\\nUse a dry-erase marker so you can erase it after you cut the sheet.\\n', 'Use a utility knife to cut along the line you marked on the board.:  Make sure the sheet is flat and stable on the surface. Apply firm pressure and use a ruler to guide your utility knife as you drag it across the line you marked to score the sheet of plexiglass. Run the knife over the line 10 or 12 times, until you\u2019ve made a deep groove in the sheet.\\nYou can also use a scoring tool to make your cuts if the blade is sharp enough to cut the plexiglass.\\nThe deeper you can make your cuts, the easier it will be to snap the board.\\n', 'Flip the sheet over and score the other side.:  After you\u2019ve formed a deep groove in 1 side of the plexiglass, grab the sheet by the sides and flip it over to expose the other side. Cut along the same line that you cut on the other side to further score the sheet. Score the plexiglass until you\u2019ve formed a groove in the sheet.\\nBe careful when you pick up the sheet so it doesn\u2019t bend or warp before you\u2019re ready to snap it.\\n', 'Position the sheet so the portion that you cut is hanging over the edge.:  Once you\u2019ve finished scoring the sheet, move it into a position that will make it easier for you to snap it off. Move the sheet so the portion that you plan to snap off is hanging over the edge.\\nBe sure the entire portion that you plan to break off is hanging over the edge of the work surface.\\n', 'Clamp the sheet in place to the surface.:  Use a spring or a C clamp and apply it to a part of the sheet that you don\u2019t plan to cut. Apply the clamp so it\u2019s attached to the sheet of plexiglass and the surface that you\u2019re working on so the sheet doesn\u2019t move.\\nBe careful not to tighten the clamp so much that it puts a dent or divot in the sheet.\\n', 'Snap off the cut portion of the plexiglass.:  With the sheet of plexiglass clamped in place on the work surface, apply quick, downward pressure to break off the piece that you cut. The sheet should break cleanly along the line that you scored in it.\\nYou can use 1 hand to brace the sheet while you push down on the sheet with the other hand.\\nIf the sheet doesn\u2019t fully break along the line, use your utility knife to cut along the groove and break off the piece.\\n', 'Use a circular saw:  with a carbide-tipped metal-cutting blade.\\nThe fewer number of teeth on the blade will minimize the amount of dust or debris that cutting the plexiglass will produce.\\nThere are blades specially designed for cutting plexiglass that you can use as well.\\n', 'Set the sheet down on a sawhorse mark where you want to cut.:  Place the sheet of plexiglass on a sawhorse so you can cut through the sheet while keeping it flat and secure. Use a straight edge or a ruler to mark a straight line on the sheet of plexiglass. This line will be your cutting guide so make sure it is straight and visible.\\nUse a dry-erase marker so you can easily erase the markings if you need to make adjustments.\\n', 'Align the cutting guide of the saw with the line you marked.:  The circular saw will have a viewer or a slot that allows you to see where the saw is lined up. Put this guide in line with the marking that you put on the sheet of plexiglass.\\n\\nMake sure the sheet is secure and doesn\u2019t shake or move.\\n', 'Bring the saw to full speed before cutting the sheet.:  The blade of the saw must be rotating at full speed before it makes contact with the sheet to create a smooth and even cut. Turn on the saw and allow it to rotate until it gets to its full speed.\\n\\nCutting the sheet before the saw has reached full speed could cause the teeth of the blade to snag on the sheet and create a jagged or choppy cut.\\n', 'Push the saw slowly and smoothly through the plexiglass sheet.:  Use the cutting guide and the straight line to guide the saw through the sheet. Push the saw at a steady and consistent pace to prevent the saw from jamming.\\nIf the saw is stuttering or catching, you may be pushing the saw too fast. Stop pushing to let the blade get back up to speed and then continue to push the blade through the sheet.\\nMake sure the 2 halves are balanced on the sawhorse so they don\u2019t fall to the ground when you finish cutting through the sheet.\\n', 'Use a jigsaw:  to make rounded cuts in the plexiglass.\\nUse an uncoated blade with fine teeth to cut plexiglass.\\nKeep a few extra blades nearby in case you need to replace it while you\u2019re cutting.\\n', 'Place the sheet of plexiglass flat on a sawhorse.:  Use a sawhorse as a work station to hold the sheet while you cut through it. Lie the sheet so it\u2019s secure and stable on the sawhorse.\\nCheck to make sure the sheet doesn\u2019t slide or wobble before you cut it.\\n', 'Mark the sheet with a dry-erase marker to guide the jigsaw.:  It\u2019s very important to have a guide to follow when you\u2019re using a jigsaw, especially if the shape you are cutting is round or irregular. A jigsaw allows you to create a specific shape, but you need to have a good marking to use as a guide. Use a dry-erase marker to create the outline of the shape you plan to cut.\\nA dry-erase marker makes it easier for you to erase the mark when you\u2019re done or if you need to alter it.\\n', 'Put on safety glasses to protect your eyes.:  Sawing a sheet of plexiglass can cause splinters and tiny particles to fly in the air. These could damage your eyes if they get in them. Before you begin sawing, put on a pair of safety glasses.\\n\\nMake sure the glasses fit securely on your head so they don\u2019t fall off while you\u2019re sawing!\\n', 'Drill a hole to fit the jigsaw into the sheet.:  The jigsaw will need an opening to fit into the plexiglass sheet, so start by drilling a hole with a drill and masonry bit large enough to make a hole that the blade will fit through. If you plan to cut shape with twists and turns, drill holes through the sheet at the tightest corners of the shape. This will help the jigsaw blade turn when it gets to those turns.\\nIf the blade of the jigsaw isn\u2019t able to take the turns easily, it could bend the blade or break it.\\n', 'Insert the saw blade into the hole and bring the blade to full speed.:  Fit the blade of the jigsaw into the hole you made in the sheet and turn it on. A jigsaw blade moves slower than a band saw or a circular saw, so it must be brought to full speed before you start using it to cut.\\nIf the blade isn\u2019t at full speed when it makes contact with the plexiglass, it could catch and bend or possibly break and damage your jigsaw.\\nIt\u2019s possible the blade could snap and injure you, so use caution.\\n', 'Push the jigsaw slowly to cut through the sheet.:  Apply steady pressure to keep the jigsaw from jumping off of the sheet. Follow your guide markings closely and slow down to take any turns. If you hear or feel the blade catching or stalling, slow down and back up to allow the blade to get back up to speed, then continue to push the saw through the plexiglass.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Dry-erase marker', 'Ruler or straight edge', 'Dry-erase marker', 'Ruler or straight edge', 'Circular saw', 'Safety glasses', 'Carbide-tipped blade', 'Dry-erase marker', 'Ruler or straight edge', 'Jigsaw', 'Safety glasses', 'Uncoated blade with small teeth', 'Power drill']}","extracted_answer":"use a circular saw:  with a carbide-tipped metal-cutting blade","question_type":"['navigation']","text_question":"Yes, please tell me about using a saw and what kind of saws would be best.","question_id":"diy-149-6","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-152","question":"Is there any painting techniques so paint is applied evenly on surfaces?

After selecting a paint that will adhere to the material, and have fun painting an old faux leather chair or creating a design on a purse or skirt!\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Use acrylic paints.:  Acrylic paint can be found in a range of colors, including metallic and glittery shades, and it can be found at an arts and crafts store. It can be applied to many surfaces and it adheres well to faux leather. Acrylic paint does not fade as easily as other paints. It is also flexible, making it is less likely to crack over time.\\n', 'Choose a leather paint.:  Leather paint is an acrylic-based paint that can be found at your local arts and crafts store. It comes in a wide variety of colors and is specifically formulated to adhere to both real leather and artificial leather. Leather paint is slightly more expensive than acrylic paint and can cost between $2 and $8 for a small bottle.\\n', 'Select chalk-based paint.:  Chalk-based paint can add a shabby chic, distressed look to an accessory or a piece of furniture.\\n', 'Clean the faux leather.:  Use a small amount of isopropyl alcohol to remove dust, dirt, grease, and wax from the faux leather. Dampen a cotton ball and wipe the entire surface of the material.

Check your local laws.","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Remove Old Carpeting', 'description': '\\nMost professionals will charge you by the square foot to remove carpet, which can cost several hundred dollars, depending on the size of the room. Whether you are replacing carpet in your home, or removing it in order to update your floors with hardwood or tile, you can save yourself some considerable money by pulling up the old carpeting yourself. Removing old carpeting is just a matter of elbow grease: Pulling it up off the floor, rolling it out of the way, and cleaning up the glue, tacks or nails that it might leave behind.\\n\\n', 'steps': [\"Get the necessary tools for the job.:  Before you start ripping up that carpet with nothing but elbow grease and ambition, it's best to get prepared for the job by getting all the tools you'll need to do it right.\\nHeavy duty leather gloves with a padded palm are essential to keeping you hands safe. You might encounter sharp nails or tacks while pulling up carpet, and a good pair of gloves will also help you grip the carpet. A dust-mask is also a good protective barrier to use, especially if you have asthma or other respiratory problems.\\nTo pry up the carpet and tacks, you'll need a pry bar, pliers, and a hammer. While you can start ripping the carpet up with your hands, getting it started and tearing it free will require some help.\\nTo keep the job clean, it's also good to have a roll of duct tape to roll up the carpet and move it after you've cut it loose, as well as a utility knife to cut strips of carpet.\\n\", \"Remove all furniture from the floor.:  Obviously, you'll need to move everything on top of the carpet out of the room and off the carpet before you start pulling it up. This can actually be more time-intensive of a process than pulling the carpet up, which shouldn't take more than 45 minutes or an hour to remove with the right technique.\\nFind temporary homes for beds, chairs, bookcases, and other furniture in the room that's having carpet replaced. Move the furniture carefully into the new space. Don't worry about pushing it over the old carpet and ruining it, since it's coming up anyway.\\n\", \"Remove the molding and other wall finishing.:  You need to get anything out of the way that will keep the corners of the carpet from coming up easily. Take off any molding or other edging that might be found between the wall and the floor.\\nFor the most part, carpet shouldn't be caught beneath the molding or the baseboard, because it's not usually installed that way. If you're replacing it you should probably remove it anyway, before you start with the carpet, but if you're going to keep it, it's best to leave it on.\\n\", \"Schedule this project for last.:  If you're remodeling an entire room, it'd be silly to put in brand new carpet before you paint the walls. Using the old carpet as a drop cloth to collect all the paint drippings before you move forward can be a real time saver. In most remodeling projects, it's best to replace the carpet as the final step in the job.\\n\\n\", \"Vacuum the carpet.:  Old carpet can be a real dust trap, and you'll make it a lot easier on yourself by cleaning it up a bit before you tear it out. Don't wrestle with damp, dusty, or super-dirty\\n\\n\", \"Pick a corner to start.:  For most jobs, it's recommended that you start in the back corner and move toward the door, but anywhere is fine. Corners are the easiest places to work the carpet up, because you've got a nice little edge to grab onto.\\nIf the carpet is already coming up anywhere, start there. Sometimes carpet will start to peel at the edges, or pets will dig at it and make your job a whole lot easier. Start wherever makes your job the most convenient.\\n\", \"Grab one corner of the carpet and pull it up from the floor.:  When you've selected your starting point, grip onto the carpet with your pliers and tug upward firmly. Don't jerk too hard, or you may rip the carpet and have to start over. Once you get a good chunk of it up, you can use your hands to start pulling backward.\\n\", 'Use the pry bar to work under the carpet.:  From the corner, work the pry bar along both edges, helping to ease the carpeting up and away from the floor. There will likely be carpet tacks that will be quite sticky, making it a lot easier to use the pry bar. Continue pulling and using the bar to separate the carpet from the floor as evenly as possible.\\n\\nRemove the carpet tacks as you find them. Look for tacks that might be attached to the bottom of the carpet. Use a pry bar and run it across the bottom of the carpet to ensure they come off before you roll it up.\\n', \"Fold it back.:  Follow the carpet down one wall and then another until the carpet has been pulled up and is loose in a large, flag-shaped portion. Keep pulling and folding the carpet back on itself until you've got a big manageable strip that you can carry.\\nDon't try to pull all the carpet up at once, or you'll have a mess on your hands. To keep it clean, it's best to take off substantial, but manageable pieces at a time. A good eyeball estimate is no more than two or three feet deep, when the carpet is folded over. In other words, pull up six feet of carpet, times the width of the room. That'll be plenty heavy for you and a helper.\\n\", \"Cut off a strip.:  When you fold the carpet back, use the utility knife to cut that section of carpet away and roll it up as evenly as possible. Even if it's a misshapen section of carpet, try to roll it up into a little bundle so it will be easier to carry. Use duct tape to secure the end of the roll, then have an assistant take one end and you take the other end, and discard the carpet.\\nEventually, you'll work through the entire carpet in this basic way. Pull up a section, cut it into a strip using a utility knife, and roll it up. This will make it easier to remove from the room and dispose of.\\n\", 'Pull up the carpet pad using the same technique.:  Carpet pads are vapor barriers that are installed under some types of carpeting. Some floors might not have any carpet pad at all. If there is a pad, it should be lighter and easier to remove than the actual carpet, but you can use the same basic technique if necessary. Start at one corner, pull up the pad, and cut it into manageable strips.\\n\\n', \"Dispose of old carpeting properly.:  For the most part, you can dispose of old ratty carpet at any garbage drop site in your town. Different areas have different rules about putting carpet out on the curb, though, so you'll want to check with the local authorities to find out about garbage pick-up where you live.\\n\\nCarpet American Recovery Effort (CARE) is an organization that collects old carpeting to recycle and use as the foundation for a variety of products, including new carpet padding and even lumber.\\nWhen you replace your carpeting, consider purchasing from Mohawk, Shaw, Miliken, or Flor, which are all carpet dealers that incorporate recycled materials into their new products.\\n\", \"Remove any tackstrips that have been left on the floor.:  If you're not going to reinstall carpet on the new floor, pull up the tackstrips by hand. They should come up relatively easily, as long as you're wearing your heavy gloves. Use the pry-bar if necessary.\\n\\nIf you are going to reinstall carpeting, inspect the tackstrips for wear and determine whether or not they're reusable. If they're dull, loose, or otherwise worn out, consider pulling them up and replacing them anyway.\\nIt's also a good idea to keep an eye out for any extra carpet nails, screws, or tacks that might be on the floor after removing the carpet. Sweep them or gather them up by hand and throw them out. Sometimes there'll be a lot of staples, which can be a pain to remove. Use your pliers to pull them up, and make sure you get them all.\\n\", \"Scrape the glue off the subfloor with your prybar or knife.:  Carpeting uses different types of adhesives, and some require a simple scraping while others will require a more thorough cleaning. Clean up the sub-floor as best as possible.\\n\\nLook for a floor cleaner that removes adhesives, if scraping doesn't the glue off like you want. You can find it in your local hardware store.\\n\", \"Check the condition of the subfloor.:  It's very important, regardless of what you want to do with the room next, that you inspect the condition of the subfloor and make any repairs necessary while you've got the carpet off. It'd be a shame to install $800 worth of new carpet over a squeaky floor, or a floor showing signs of mold.\\n\\nWalk around the sub-floor and bounce on it. Subfloor panels should be attached to the wood joists with screws or nails, and if you find some panels that squeak, you can secure it to the joist with ring shank nails. These are grooved nails with more secure gripping power, decreasing the chances that this squeaky area will ever squeak again. About two or three inches from the previous nail or screw, hammer in a shank nail and you'll be set.\\nIf your carpeting was damaged or wet, it might have impacted the subfloor. Look for signs of rot or mold. If you see any signs of serious damage or rot, you need to have these panels replaced before installing new flooring.\\n\", \"Vacuum up the rest of the debris.:  Once you're done making your repairs, sweep or shop-vac up the remaining debris and glue-scrapings from the job before moving forward with installation.

Sunflowers, on the other hand, can be harvested for seeds that, with a little preparation, make for an incredibly tasty treat.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Wait until the sunflower begins to wilt.:  Sunflowers are ready to harvest once the heads become brown. If you have a particularly wet season however, they can go mouldy [if this is the case you will need to cut off the head once the back of it is yellowing and allow the drying process to continue in a greenhouse or shed]. You should prepare them for the drying process once the back of the head begins to turn yellow to yellow-brown.\\n\\nIn order to harvest the seeds, the sunflower head must be completely dry. Otherwise, the flower will not surrender the seeds. A sunflower will reach this state naturally after a few days of beginning to wilt.\\nIt is easier to dry sunflowers on the stem if you have dry, sunny weather. If you live in a moist climate, you may want to consider drying them off the stem, instead.\\nAt least half of the yellow petals should have dropped before you start preparing the sunflower for harvest. The head of the flower should also begin to droop. It may look dead, but if it still has its seeds, then the sunflower is drying out in a healthy manner.\\nExamine the seeds. Even if they are still stuck on the flower head, they should begin to plump up. The seeds should also be hard and may have their trademark black-and-white striped shell, or purely black, depending on the type of sunflower.\\n', 'Tie a paper bag over the head.: You could also use cheesecloth or similarly breathable fabric, but you should never use a plastic bag. Plastic will restrict the air flow, causing moisture to build up on the seeds. If too much moisture builds up, the seeds may turn rotted or moldy.\\nTying a bag over the head prevents birds, squirrels, and most other wildlife from sneaking in and \"harvesting\" your sunflower seeds before you do. It also prevents the seeds from dropping to the ground and being lost.\\n', 'Change the bag as needed.:  If the bag gets wet or torn, carefully remove it and replace it with a fresh, intact paper bag.\\n\\nYou may be able to prevent the bag from getting wet during a rainstorm by temporarily placing a plastic bag over it. Do not tie the plastic bag onto the flower head, though, and remove it as soon as the rain lets up to prevent mold from setting in.\\nChange the paper bag as soon as it gets wet. A wet paper bag is more likely to be torn, and mold may even develop on the seeds if they sit in a wet bag for an extended period of time.\\nCollect any seeds that may have dropped off into the old bag when changing it out. Examine the seeds for signs of possible damage, and if they are in good shape, store them in airtight containers until you are ready to harvest the remaining seeds.\\n', 'Cut off the heads.:  Once the back of the flower heads turn brown, cut them off and prepare to harvest the seeds.\\n\\nLeave roughly 1 ft (30.5 cm) of stem attached to the flower head.\\nMake sure that the paper bag is still securely tied onto the flower head. If it slips off as you remove and transport the sunflower head, you may lose a significant number of seeds.\\n', 'Prepare yellowed sunflowers for drying.:  Sunflowers are ready to be dried once the back of the head begins to turn a deep yellow to yellow-brown.\\n\\nThe sunflower head must be dried before you collect the seeds.

Here is a step by step walk through of how to do that. ","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Grow Bamboo', 'description': \"\\nBamboo can be a tricky plant to grow, especially if you live in climates that face either intense hot or cold temperatures, but it is relatively inexpensive and can add a special touch to your yard. If you're interested in growing bamboo, here's what you need to do.\\n\\n\", 'steps': ['Know the difference between the three major types of bamboo.:  Bamboo plants are typically classified as clumping bamboo, running bamboo, or reeds.\\n\\nReeds are rarely planted in yards, if ever, so you can expect to deal with either clumping or running bamboo.\\nRunning bamboo sends out rhizomes, which spread into other areas, causing the plant to become invasive.\\nClumping bamboo grows in tight clusters and rarely spreads out over larger areas.\\n', 'Pick the best bamboo variety for your climate.:  Most bamboo varieties do best in tropical climates, but if you live in a somewhat cooler area, there are a few hardier varieties you can attempt to grow with some success.\\n\\nIf you living in warmer hardiness zones, like zones 7 through 10, a few good choices might be\\nFor slightly cooler climates, like those found in hardiness zones 5 and 6, try the clumping type\\n', 'Pick the best spot in your yard.:  Bamboo needs a great deal of sun, so you should usually pick a spot in your yard that receives 8 or more hours of sun daily. Note that some tropical species do require shade during the hottest parts of the day, however.\\n\\nShade can be especially important during winter. The combination of frost and direct sunlight can dehydrate the plant quickly. As such, if you live in an area that receives frost during winter, you should opt for a spot that receives partial shade instead of one with direct sun.\\n', 'Amend the soil.:  While bamboo can do well in many types of soil, it does best in loam or marly soils. Improve your odds of success by digging and mixing in amendments to the soil before planting.\\n\\nWork garden compost or manure into the soil to provide it with additional nutrients. Ideally, the compost should be worked into the bottom of the transplant hole so that the bamboo roots sit on top of it.\\nLoam soil is a mixture of five parts topsoil composted with two parts sand, two parts silt, and one part clay.\\nAvoid rocky or soggy soils, as well as soils that are relatively impermeable.\\n', 'Prepare for wind.:  Bamboo has a shallow root system, yet it also grows tall and fast. As a result, it can easily get damaged by strong winds. You will need a barrier to prevent this from happening.\\n\\nThe easiest way to protect your bamboo is to position them behind garden hedges or trees. Otherwise, you might need to build a fence around the area.\\n', 'Prevent bamboo from spreading.:  If you are planting running bamboo, you will need to construct a barrier to prevent the bamboo from invading other parts of your yard.\\n\\nAfter determining the area in which you want to confine the bamboo, install barriers of sheet metal or concrete around the perimeter. These barriers should be 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) deep.\\n', 'Plant during spring.:  Bamboo grows quickly and needs quick access to warm, frost-free temperatures. Sow the seeds after the final frost of the season for best results.\\n\\nIf you are starting your bamboo plants from seeds, you should start in the very early spring so that the plants have enough time to establish themselves by summer. If you are transplanting established seedlings, any part of spring is suitable for planting.\\nYou should avoid planting bamboo in the fall, especially if you live in cooler climates, since the plant needs time to harden before cold, drying winds of winter begin.\\nConversely, if you live in severely hot climates that regularly reach temperatures hotter than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), you need to plant the bamboo early enough in the spring or in the early fall to avoid the intense heat of summer.\\n', 'Prepare the seeds.:  Bamboo seeds need to be cleaned and dried in the sun for 1 to 2 hours. Afterward, you should soak the seeds in clean water to break them out of dormancy. Soak the seeds for 6 to 12 hours.\\n\\nDrain the water 10 to 20 minutes before you sow the seeds.\\n', 'Plant the seeds in plastic seedling containers.:  If growing bamboo from seed, you will likely have better results if you plant the seeds in soil-filled plastic pallets meant for seedling growth.\\n\\nFill the seedling containers with a mixture made from 8 parts topsoil, 1 part ashes, and 1 part fine wood chips or rice husks. Filter this mixture through a wire mesh to remove stones and debris before filling the containers.\\nWhen filling the containers, leave the soil fairly loose.\\nMake small holes 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) deep in the center of each seedling compartment. Drop one seed in each hole and cover the seeds gently with additional soil.\\nMoisten the soil immediately and water daily. Let the seeds grow in an area of partial shade.\\n', 'Transplant seedlings after 3 to 4 months.:  Even though adult bamboo grows quickly, in the early stages, most species of bamboo will not be strong enough to transplant any earlier than this. Transplant the seedlings into small, separate pots or into poly bags filled with a mixture made of two parts manure, three parts soil, and one part sand.\\n\\nBamboo seeds usually germinate after 10 to 25 days, and initially, the leaves are very fragile.\\nIt takes 3 to 4 months before the seedlings produce a rhizome, or stem, capable of producing new sprouts. This is the point in time at which bamboo can be transplanted.\\nNote that if you are transplanting bamboo seedlings instead of growing the plant from seeds, these are the instructions you need to pay attention to.\\n', 'Space bamboo 3 to 5 feet (1 to 1 1\/2 m) apart when transplanting them to your yard.: The plants should be transplanted to your yard once they reach 16 to 20 inches (40 to 50 cm) tall. Remove them from their pots or poly fill bags and place them directly into the ground.\\nThe hole you transplant the bamboo into should be roughly twice as wide as the bamboo root mass.\\nIf working with clumping bamboo, you can place them within 1 to 2 feet (30.5 to 61 cm) since these varieties will not spread out much.\\nNote that clumping bamboo gains 1 to 2 feet (30.5 to 61 cm) of height yearly, while running bamboo gains 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 m) of height yearly and spreads out at about the same rate.\\n', 'Water the bamboo regularly.: Bamboo seeds and young shoots should be watered daily during mild and dry weather.\\nAfter bamboo plants have been established in your yard, you should water them twice a week during mild weather and three to four times a week during hot or windy weather.\\n', 'Spread mulch.:  Organic mulches help keep bamboo growth in check and can protect the bamboo from potential threats.\\n\\nGrass clippings make one of the best mulches for bamboo since they are rich in nitrogen and silica. Compost and hay can work well, too, as do many other types of organic and untreated mulch.\\n', \"Protect the bamboo in winter.:  Bamboo is a warm weather plant, so you should take extra precautions during winter to prevent the plant's roots from completely freezing.\\n\\nApply an extra thick layer of mulch to protect the root systems of the mulch during freezing temperatures.\\nIf cold, harsh winds are a problem, you might need to construct a temporary barrier to shield your bamboo.\\nIf your bamboo takes on a dry look or silver color, this could be an indication of cold injury.\\n\", 'Use a fertilizer high in nitrogen.:  Organic fertilizers are often recommended, and nitrogen promotes stronger, greener plant growth, so a fertilizer fairly high in nitrogen is usually best.\\n\\nApply fertilizer once in the early spring and once in the summer.

Haven't we already planted the bamboo? ","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Grow Bamboo', 'description': \"\\nBamboo can be a tricky plant to grow, especially if you live in climates that face either intense hot or cold temperatures, but it is relatively inexpensive and can add a special touch to your yard. If you're interested in growing bamboo, here's what you need to do.\\n\\n\", 'steps': ['Know the difference between the three major types of bamboo.:  Bamboo plants are typically classified as clumping bamboo, running bamboo, or reeds.\\n\\nReeds are rarely planted in yards, if ever, so you can expect to deal with either clumping or running bamboo.\\nRunning bamboo sends out rhizomes, which spread into other areas, causing the plant to become invasive.\\nClumping bamboo grows in tight clusters and rarely spreads out over larger areas.\\n', 'Pick the best bamboo variety for your climate.:  Most bamboo varieties do best in tropical climates, but if you live in a somewhat cooler area, there are a few hardier varieties you can attempt to grow with some success.\\n\\nIf you living in warmer hardiness zones, like zones 7 through 10, a few good choices might be\\nFor slightly cooler climates, like those found in hardiness zones 5 and 6, try the clumping type\\n', 'Pick the best spot in your yard.:  Bamboo needs a great deal of sun, so you should usually pick a spot in your yard that receives 8 or more hours of sun daily. Note that some tropical species do require shade during the hottest parts of the day, however.\\n\\nShade can be especially important during winter. The combination of frost and direct sunlight can dehydrate the plant quickly. As such, if you live in an area that receives frost during winter, you should opt for a spot that receives partial shade instead of one with direct sun.\\n', 'Amend the soil.:  While bamboo can do well in many types of soil, it does best in loam or marly soils. Improve your odds of success by digging and mixing in amendments to the soil before planting.\\n\\nWork garden compost or manure into the soil to provide it with additional nutrients. Ideally, the compost should be worked into the bottom of the transplant hole so that the bamboo roots sit on top of it.\\nLoam soil is a mixture of five parts topsoil composted with two parts sand, two parts silt, and one part clay.\\nAvoid rocky or soggy soils, as well as soils that are relatively impermeable.\\n', 'Prepare for wind.:  Bamboo has a shallow root system, yet it also grows tall and fast. As a result, it can easily get damaged by strong winds. You will need a barrier to prevent this from happening.\\n\\nThe easiest way to protect your bamboo is to position them behind garden hedges or trees. Otherwise, you might need to build a fence around the area.\\n', 'Prevent bamboo from spreading.:  If you are planting running bamboo, you will need to construct a barrier to prevent the bamboo from invading other parts of your yard.\\n\\nAfter determining the area in which you want to confine the bamboo, install barriers of sheet metal or concrete around the perimeter. These barriers should be 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) deep.\\n', 'Plant during spring.:  Bamboo grows quickly and needs quick access to warm, frost-free temperatures. Sow the seeds after the final frost of the season for best results.\\n\\nIf you are starting your bamboo plants from seeds, you should start in the very early spring so that the plants have enough time to establish themselves by summer. If you are transplanting established seedlings, any part of spring is suitable for planting.\\nYou should avoid planting bamboo in the fall, especially if you live in cooler climates, since the plant needs time to harden before cold, drying winds of winter begin.\\nConversely, if you live in severely hot climates that regularly reach temperatures hotter than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), you need to plant the bamboo early enough in the spring or in the early fall to avoid the intense heat of summer.\\n', 'Prepare the seeds.:  Bamboo seeds need to be cleaned and dried in the sun for 1 to 2 hours. Afterward, you should soak the seeds in clean water to break them out of dormancy. Soak the seeds for 6 to 12 hours.\\n\\nDrain the water 10 to 20 minutes before you sow the seeds.\\n', 'Plant the seeds in plastic seedling containers.:  If growing bamboo from seed, you will likely have better results if you plant the seeds in soil-filled plastic pallets meant for seedling growth.\\n\\nFill the seedling containers with a mixture made from 8 parts topsoil, 1 part ashes, and 1 part fine wood chips or rice husks. Filter this mixture through a wire mesh to remove stones and debris before filling the containers.\\nWhen filling the containers, leave the soil fairly loose.\\nMake small holes 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) deep in the center of each seedling compartment. Drop one seed in each hole and cover the seeds gently with additional soil.\\nMoisten the soil immediately and water daily. Let the seeds grow in an area of partial shade.\\n', 'Transplant seedlings after 3 to 4 months.:  Even though adult bamboo grows quickly, in the early stages, most species of bamboo will not be strong enough to transplant any earlier than this. Transplant the seedlings into small, separate pots or into poly bags filled with a mixture made of two parts manure, three parts soil, and one part sand.\\n\\nBamboo seeds usually germinate after 10 to 25 days, and initially, the leaves are very fragile.\\nIt takes 3 to 4 months before the seedlings produce a rhizome, or stem, capable of producing new sprouts. This is the point in time at which bamboo can be transplanted.\\nNote that if you are transplanting bamboo seedlings instead of growing the plant from seeds, these are the instructions you need to pay attention to.\\n', 'Space bamboo 3 to 5 feet (1 to 1 1\/2 m) apart when transplanting them to your yard.: The plants should be transplanted to your yard once they reach 16 to 20 inches (40 to 50 cm) tall. Remove them from their pots or poly fill bags and place them directly into the ground.\\nThe hole you transplant the bamboo into should be roughly twice as wide as the bamboo root mass.\\nIf working with clumping bamboo, you can place them within 1 to 2 feet (30.5 to 61 cm) since these varieties will not spread out much.\\nNote that clumping bamboo gains 1 to 2 feet (30.5 to 61 cm) of height yearly, while running bamboo gains 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 m) of height yearly and spreads out at about the same rate.\\n', 'Water the bamboo regularly.: Bamboo seeds and young shoots should be watered daily during mild and dry weather.\\nAfter bamboo plants have been established in your yard, you should water them twice a week during mild weather and three to four times a week during hot or windy weather.\\n', 'Spread mulch.:  Organic mulches help keep bamboo growth in check and can protect the bamboo from potential threats.\\n\\nGrass clippings make one of the best mulches for bamboo since they are rich in nitrogen and silica. Compost and hay can work well, too, as do many other types of organic and untreated mulch.\\n', \"Protect the bamboo in winter.:  Bamboo is a warm weather plant, so you should take extra precautions during winter to prevent the plant's roots from completely freezing.\\n\\nApply an extra thick layer of mulch to protect the root systems of the mulch during freezing temperatures.\\nIf cold, harsh winds are a problem, you might need to construct a temporary barrier to shield your bamboo.\\nIf your bamboo takes on a dry look or silver color, this could be an indication of cold injury.\\n\", 'Use a fertilizer high in nitrogen.:  Organic fertilizers are often recommended, and nitrogen promotes stronger, greener plant growth, so a fertilizer fairly high in nitrogen is usually best.\\n\\nApply fertilizer once in the early spring and once in the summer. This schedule corresponds to the main growth seasons of bamboo.\\nIf using an organic and mild bamboo, you can apply fertilizer monthly throughout the spring, summer, and early fall.\\n', \"Thin and prune the bamboo as needed.:  As bamboo spreads, you might need to thin it out to prevent the stalks from crowding into one another and cutting off nutrient supplies.\\n\\nIf you want to prevent running bamboo from spreading and do not have a barrier installed that can do so, you will need to cut new shoots off at ground level as soon as they appear in areas you do not want the bamboo in.\\nRemove old, unattractive bamboo branches once a year.

Thank you for your guidance. | student: What good advice. Thanks. Are there any other tips or advice you have about Cast Iron cookery, or am I done?","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Clean Rust Off Cast Iron', 'description': \"\\nCast iron pans and pots are prone to rust. Luckily, if you notice rust on cast iron, there are plenty of ways to remove it. It can be removed using salt if it's a small amount of rust. A larger amount of rust may require a vinegar soak. In the future, make an effort to care for your cast iron to minimize rust.\\n\\n\", 'steps': ['Sprinkle salt on the cast iron.:  The precise amount of salt you need varies depending on the size of your pan. Sprinkle salt to the point the surface of the cast iron is covered in a somewhat thick layer.\\nFor example, about half a cup of salt would be used for a 12 inch cast iron pan.\\n', \"Scrub the pan with a potato.:  Cut a potato in half. The potato will be coarse enough to rub away rust as you rub the salt into the cast iron. Place it on the cast iron cut side down and scrub the salt in to remove rust.\\nUse a great deal of pressure as this will help scrape off the rust.\\nRub the potato in a circular motion.\\nIf you're scrubbing something like a pot or pan, do not forget the sides and bottom.\\n\", \"Rinse and dry your pan.:  Once you've scraped away the rust, rinse your pan under the faucet. Get out any remaining traces of salt and potato. Immediately pat dry your pan with paper towel. Then, place your pan on the stove over low heat. This will help get rid of any lingering moisture.\\nIt's very important to dry your pan off immediately. Water causes rust with cast iron pans, and if you leave your pan wet it will just get rusty again.\\n\", 'Re-season your pan.:  Unfortunately, removing rust removes the seasoning of a cast iron pan. After treating it with salt, apply a small amount of vegetable or olive to the pan using a paper towel. Then, take a clean paper towel and remove any excess oil. Place your pan over low heat for about 30 minutes. This should re-season the pan.\\nBlot off any excess oil after removing your pan from the heat and storing it.\\n', \"Mix equal parts white vinegar and water.:  Vinegar can help remove rust from a pan that's very damaged. Make a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water. The precise amounts you need depend on how big the piece of cast iron is. Use enough white vinegar and water so you can fully submerge the pan.\\nMix the white vinegar and water where you want to soak the pan, such as the sink or the bucket.\\n\", 'Soak the pan.:  Make sure the entire piece of cast iron is submerged in the mixture. Place the cast iron pan into your sink or bucket. You can let it soak until the rust is removed.\\n', 'Check the pan regularly as it soaks.:  How long a pan needs to soak varies. Cast iron should not be soaked for more than eight hours, but depending on the level of rust you may want to remove it sooner. Check the pan every half hour or so. Remove it as soon as the rust has dissolved. If you leave the pan in the vinegar after the rust dissolves, the vinegar will eat away at the cast iron itself.\\n', 'Wash the cast iron.:  After removing the cast iron from the vinegar, wash it right away. Scrub your pan with mild detergent and soapy water to remove any lingering vinegar residue. Use a gentle scrub brush or sponge. Rough sponges can damage cast iron.\\n', 'Place the cast iron in the oven.:  Pat the cast iron dry right away with a cloth or paper towel. Then, place it in a warm oven for about half an hour. This should remove any excess water.\\n', 'Re-season your pan.:  As soaking the cast iron removes the seasoning, re-season the pan after removing the rust. Rub the cast iron down with an oil like vegetable oil. Then, place the cast iron in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Let it bake for about 45 minutes to an hour.\\n', 'Clean the pan correctly.:  Poor cleaning techniques can cause a cast iron pan to rust. You should never soak it in water. Clean it immediately after using it with coarse salt to remove set in food. Unless the pan is very dirty, avoid washing it with soap and water. Dry the pan completely after washing.\\n', 'Keep the pan dry.:  Make sure not to let your pan get wet. Never soak cast iron in the sink or put it in the dish washer. Cast iron will rust if you allow it to get wet.\\n', 'Store the pan safely.:  Store your pan away from water to prevent rust. Place a paper towel in the pan when you store. This will keep the pan free of dust, minimizing how often it needs cleaning.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"You are done","question_type":"['navigation', 'history']","text_question":"Thank you for your help, I am all done now.","question_id":"diy-186-6","intent_question":"stop","intent_answer":"answer_question_external_fact"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-188","question":"The vinegar smell is still there, do i keep repeating until gone?

To stay safe, suit up in long sleeves, pants, and safety goggles.  Fill your low-pressure agricultural sprayer with a specialized asphalt-cleaning agent.  Spray it across the shingles you wish to clean, wait about 20 minutes, then rinse them with water.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Protect yourself.:   To stay safe, wear slip-resistant shoes.  Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes.  Attach yourself to the chimney or another secure point using a safety rope, if necessary.  Wear long sleeves and pants to avoid getting the cleaning agent on your skin.\\nBefore venturing out onto the roof, let someone know you\u2019ll be doing so.  That way, if you suffer an accident or injury on the roof, they\u2019ll be able to find you.\\n', 'Remove excess debris.:   Before using a cleaning agent to clean your asphalt shingles use a leaf blower or broom to sweep the shingles clean.  Get rid of leaves, branches, and other debris that that may be on the shingles.  This will make your efforts more effective and prevent you from dangerous situations like tripping on branches.\\nWhen using the leaf blower to clear debris, blow from the ridge toward the edge of the roof.  This will prevent branches and other debris from lodging beneath the shingles\u2019 edges.\\nThere\u2019s no need to wash the shingles before using the chemical cleaner.\\n', 'Clean the asphalt shingles on cloudy days.:   If you clean your roof on a day that is too hot or sunny, the cleaner will not have much time to work before it evaporates.  Plus, it is easier to work outdoors on days that are less hot and humid.  Therefore, clean asphalt shingles on cloudy days.\\nAdditionally, don\u2019t clean your asphalt tiles on days when the cleaning agent could freeze.  In other words, only clean your asphalt shingles on days when the temperature will remain above 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees Celsius).\\nStay off the roof during very windy days.\\n', 'Protect nearby plant life.:   Before you get started, place bags over shrubs or plants that might be sprayed indirectly as a result of your cleaning.  This will protect them from the potentially lethal chemicals in the cleaning agent.\\n', 'Choose your cleaning agent.:   You cannot effectively clean asphalt shingles with just soap and water.  Instead, you\u2019ll have to choose a specially-formulated cleaning agent.  Whenever possible, choose a noncorrosive and environmentally friendly cleaning product.\\nCommonly used cleaning agents include Roof Shampoo and Shingle Roof Mold Cleaner OX.\\nIf you don\u2019t want to buy a commercial cleaner, you can easily make your own by mixing equal amounts of laundry-strength chlorine bleach and water.\\n', 'Pour the cleaning agent into a spraying device.:   Fill a low-pressure agricultural sprayer or a pump-up garden sprayer with the asphalt cleaning agent.  For more information regarding how to pour your cleaning agent into the spraying device, consult manufacturer directions.\\nGenerally, you\u2019ll need to unscrew the tops of the spraying device and the cleaning agent, fill the spraying device, then screw the tops of the cleaning agent and the spraying device back on.\\nDon\u2019t use a pressure washer to apply the cleaning agent.  Doing so can damage your asphalt shingles.  Use a low-pressure sprayer rated about 30 PSI.\\n', 'Apply the cleaning agent to the roof.:   After clambering out onto your roof, spray the asphalt shingles you wish to clean.  Generally, you\u2019ll need to point the nozzle of the spraying device toward the shingle you wish to clean, then depress the handle.  After applying the cleaning agent, allow it to work its magic for about 20 minutes.\\nThe exact method by which you can spray the asphalt shingles varies slightly depending on the type of spraying device you\u2019ve decided to use.  Consult manufacturer directions for more information.\\nThe amount of cleaning agent you\u2019ll need to use depends on the number and size of the asphalt shingles you wish to clean.  Generally, the more shingles you want to clean, the more cleaning agent you\u2019ll need.\\nYou can identify asphalt shingles that need to be cleaned by looking for black, green, or blue stains.  This indicates the presence of algae or moss.\\n', 'Spray the roof with water.:   After about 20 minutes, spray the asphalt shingles with water from your garden hose.  This will rinse away excess cleaning agent.  If it\u2019s more convenient, empty the low-pressure sprayer and fill it with water to rinse your asphalt shingles.\\n', 'Scrub tenacious moss or algae.:   If moss or algae growth on your asphalt shingles is particularly thick, use a medium-stiff bristled broom or brush to loosen it with a gentle back-and-forth scraping motion.  Don\u2019t use too much force, however, or you could loosen the mineral granule from the shingle.\\nIf you\u2019re having a hard time getting your asphalt shingles clean, let the roof dry, then spray it with the cleaning agent and rinse it with water again.\\n', 'Use algae-resistant shingles.:   Some asphalt shingles contain copper.  Since copper is toxic to algae, this sort of asphalt shingle will naturally stay free of algae.  This sort of shingle is especially preferable if you live in an area prone to algae growth.\\nAlternately, you could affix a strip of zinc or copper just below the ridge of your roof.  The zinc or copper particles will trickle down the roof when it rains, inhibiting algae growth.\\n', 'Trim tree growth that hangs over the asphalt shingles.:   If your asphalt shingles are beneath tree cover, algae is more likely to grow.  Trim back tree branches to let the sunlight naturally discourage the growth of algae.\\n', 'Clear your roof of debris.:   Even when you aren\u2019t preparing to clean your asphalt shingles, it\u2019s a good idea to venture out onto your roof semi-regularly to keep it clear of branches, leaves, and other plant matter.  Doing so will discourage algae and moss growth.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"place bags over shrubs or plants","question_type":"['confirmation', 'complex']","text_question":"Should the bags be plastic bags?","question_id":"diy-195-2","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_external_fact"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-197","question":"What are the benefits to using hydrogen peroxide in the garden?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Use-Hydrogen-Peroxide-in-the-Garden","data_split":"test","original_answer":"Hydrogen peroxide disinfects things and reduces the risk of contamination.","history":"None","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Use Hydrogen Peroxide in the Garden', 'description': '\\nDid you know that the bottle of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in your medicine cabinet has benefits other than anti-septic and bleaching ones?

Spray this on the leaves and root structures of plants that show signs of fungal infections. These include powdery mildew, rust, and mold.\\nSpray on a small area before applying more generously to larger-scale surfaces. This can prevent chemical burn on your plant tissues.\\n', 'Fight bacterial rot.:  Pour or spray a mixture of peroxide and water with an anti-fungicide (benomyl) on to a plant exhibiting root rot. Saturate the plant so that the mixture flushes out stagnant, dead water and can replace it with fresh, highly oxygenated water.

In turn, your hydroponics may flourish.\\n', 'Sanitize seeds.:  Soak new seeds in 3% hydrogen peroxide heated to 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C) for 5 minutes. After heating, rinse off the seeds under running water for a minute. This can prevent contamination from foodborne illnesses caused by salmonella, E. coli, and listeria.\\n', 'Decontaminate growing medium.:  Soak growing medium such as sand or soil in a 3-6% solution of hydrogen peroxide. Allow the medium to sit in the mixture overnight. Turn the mixture once or twice to circulate throughout the medium. This can kill bacteria, mold or mildew, worms and their eggs.\\n', 'Accelerate seed germination.:  Once you\u2019ve placed your disinfected seeds in the growing material, they\u2019re ready to sprout, or germinate.\\nUse a weak solution of hydrogen peroxide and water to water the plant bed for up to two weeks after sowing the seeds.\\n', 'Fertilize with hydrogen peroxide.:  Mix 2 teaspoons hydrogen per gallon of water for plant food. Spray or pour onto your potted plants and garden every 3-5 days or as necessary.\\n', 'Promote root development.:  Mix one pint of 3% hydrogen peroxide into a gallon of water. Water the entire plant, soaking the roots thoroughly, once every week. This oxygenates the root area, promoting development during any stage of the plant\u2019s life.\\nWater root cuttings and bare root plants with this mixture.\\n', 'Treat fungal infections.:  Combine 4 tablespoons of 3% hydrogen peroxide with a pint of water in a spray bottle. Spray this on the leaves and root structures of plants that show signs of fungal infections. These include powdery mildew, rust, and mold.\\nSpray on a small area before applying more generously to larger-scale surfaces. This can prevent chemical burn on your plant tissues.\\n', 'Fight bacterial rot.:  Pour or spray a mixture of peroxide and water with an anti-fungicide (benomyl) on to a plant exhibiting root rot. Saturate the plant so that the mixture flushes out stagnant, dead water and can replace it with fresh, highly oxygenated water. This can stop bacterial infections, including root rot, that often turn fruits, flower buds, bulbs and tubers to rot into a mush.\\nDip bulbs and tubers into this mixture when preparing them for storage. It may prevent a bacterial infection.\\n', 'Kill weeds.:  Pour a 10% hydrogen peroxide solution on weeds growing between concrete, flagstone pavers, or brick. Leave the peroxide on the plants to scorch them and then remove the weeds by hand. This can kill any existing weeds in your garden and may prevent them from returning. It\u2019s also a natural weed-killer that doesn\u2019t use chemicals.\\nPour the peroxide on in the early morning or late evening to prevent the sun from quickly breaking down the solution.\\nAvoid pouring over weeds that are in pots or plant beds. This may scorch both the weeds and your plants, killing both.\\nFlush any area of your body that comes into contact with this solution immediately with plenty of cold water.\\n', 'Repel insects.:  Combine one tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide to 8 ounces of water if your plants are infested by pests.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"fertilize with hydrogen peroxide","question_type":"['confirmation']","text_question":"So I've watered the plants, made sure the roots are hydrated, now I just rinse and repeat while my plants are growing?","question_id":"diy-197-7","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"ask_student_question"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-200","question":"I was curious about that, why do we use vinegar and not just soap and water?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Clean-Plantation-Shutters","data_split":"test","original_answer":"Water can cause the wood to warp.

Give it a quick vacuuming after hanging it outside.\\n', 'Try dabbing it with water and a mild detergent first.:  If a stain has set, your first course of action should be to try cool water and mild soap.\\nRemember to use as little water as possible when cleaning spills and stains.\\n', 'Spray the stain with an enzymatic cleaner.:  If your first attempt is unsuccessful, try a slightly stronger cleaner. Find an enzyme cleaner in a spray bottle at a nearby home, grocery, or department store.

Mix together one part cool water and one part white distilled vinegar, then transfer the solution to a spray bottle. Add a teaspoon of lemon juice to the solution to help cut the vinegar smell.\\nSpray the pillow lightly with the vinegar solution then let it stand for five minutes.\\n', 'Blot the area with a damp cloth.:  After letting the cleaner stand for 5 minutes, dampen a clean cloth or paper towel with cool water. Use it to blot the affected area and gradually work out the stain.\\nRepeat the spray, let stand, and blot process until you have removed the stain.\\n', 'Avoid ruining your pillow to get out a stubborn stain.:  If you cannot remove a stain, remember that the pillow will be covered by its case and the stain won\u2019t be visible. Don\u2019t scrub or soak the pillow or use a harsh cleaner. If there\u2019s no bad odor, it\u2019s better to have an invisible stain than a ruined pillow.\\n\\n', 'Dry the pillow completely before replacing the pillowcase.:  Give the pillow 12 to 24 hours to air dry completely or use a blow dryer on a cool setting. Replacing the pillowcase while the pillow is still wet could encourage mold growth.

Rat droppings can carry deadly diseases, like the hantavirus, which humans can contract by breathing it in from rat droppings, urine, and saliva. Before cleaning, be sure that you have trapped any rats in your home and prevented their re-entry. Next, carefully clean and disinfect the areas where you have found their droppings. For very serious infestations, call in professional help.[1]\\nX\\nResearch source\\nsouthernnevadahealthdistrict.org\/health-topics\/hantavirus.php\\n\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Ventilate the space where you will clean.:  Open the doors and windows of the area where you need to clean the droppings. Ventilate this space for at least 30 minutes before you begin cleaning. If you are dealing with a very large number of droppings, wear a face mask or ventilator while cleaning.\\nConsider wearing an eye mask when cleaning after large infestations of rats.\\n', 'Don\u2019t sweep or vacuum up rat droppings.:  This will release any pathogens into the air and can also trap pathogens in your vacuum or on your broom. Instead, only clean up the droppings with a commercial disinfectant or a 10% chlorine bleach solution.

Use this technique on any hard surfaces and in the insulation. Remove any insulation that has a large number of rat droppings, especially if these droppings are below the top surface of the insulation. Put heavily soiled insulation in a plastic bag and dispose of it immediately.\\nYou\u2019ll have to replace the insulation.\\n', 'Wipe all floors and surfaces.:  Mop the floors where you\u2019ve removed the droppings and wipe down counters with the 10% chlorine bleach solution. Use a paper towel to wipe surfaces. If bleach will ruin your floor or counters, spray the floor or counters with 3% hydrogen peroxide.\\n', 'Follow up with vinegar.:  After mopping and wiping the counters, spray pure white vinegar on the hydrogen peroxide and wipe the floors and counters clean. Next, soak your mop in commercial disinfectant or the 10% chlorine bleach solution and rinse it in hot water. Immediately dispose of all paper towels you used to wipe surfaces and dispose of your plastic or latex gloves. Alternatively, wash your gloves thoroughly with soap and hot water.\\n\\n', 'Wash your furniture and clothing.:  Steam clean or shampoo any furniture that had droppings on it. Put any clothing you wore to clean the rat droppings in a washing machine and clean them with laundry detergent and hot water. Put the shoes you wore to clean the droppings in the washing machine with your clothes.\\nHand wash clothing or shoes that can\u2019t go in the washing machine.

This means fog in the summer is caused when the hot air outside hits your cool windshield. Winter fog gathers when the warm air in your car meets your cold windshield.  Understanding how the fog is created can help you get rid of it depending on the season. You can also take steps to prevent your windshield from fogging, saving yourself some time. \\n\\n', 'steps': ['Turn down the AC if it\u2019s warm outside.:  If you\u2019ve got foggy windows in the summer, turn down your air conditioner. This will warm up your car and get the inside air temperature to match the outside a bit better. You can also open your windows a bit to allow more outside air in (and it prevents your car from becoming too stifling).\\n', 'Turn on your windshield wipers.:  If the fog is on the outside of your windshield (as it will be during the summer), you can remove it with your windshield wipers.\\n', 'Open your windows.:  This is a quick way to get the temperature inside your car to match the temperature outside. Roll down your windows as far as you can so that the warm air outside gets into the cool interior of your car.\\n', 'Change your air source.:  Most cars come equipped with buttons that allow you to recirculate the air already in your car or to pull air in from outside. If your windshield is fogging, change the setting so the air gets pulled into the car from the outside. Look for the button that has a little car with an arrow pointing inside the car. Tap this so the light above it is on. \\nAlternatively, tap the button with a car and circular arrow inside of it so the light goes off. This turns off the function that recirculates the air already inside of your car.\\n', 'Lower the temperature in your car.:  Because fog is caused by differing air temperatures, getting the air temperature inside your car to match the air outside will reduce fog. Turn your car fans on the highest setting.\\nThis is the fastest method but also the coldest, so be prepared to shiver a bit!\\n', 'Turn on the defrost vent with cool air.:  The defrost vent will direct air straight at your windshield, but the cool air will help your windshield temperature match the air temperature outside. This can help get rid of the fog on your windshield.\\n', 'Use silica cat litter.:  Fill a sock with silica cat litter. Tie off the end with a piece of string, and then place one or two full socks near the front of your dashboard. This should absorb the moisture inside your car over night, preventing any fog buildup.\\n', 'Apply shaving cream to your windshield.:  Use the type of shaving cream that foams up when you squirt it out of the can or bottle. Spray a small amount of cream onto a soft cotton cloth and spread it over your entire windshield. Use a clean, dry rag to wipe it off. This should create a moisture barrier on your window, preventing fog build up.\\n', 'Roll your windows down if you can.:  If your car is in a secure area, roll your windows down about a half inch or so. This allows some outside air to get in to the car, and can prevent the windshield from fogging.\\nThis method is best for the summer time, since you don\u2019t want to risk any ice or snow getting into your car during the winter.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"roll down your windows","question_type":"['complex']","text_question":"What if I am driving a really old car without this option?","question_id":"diy-221-2","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-225","question":"Is there a specific temperature I should have the water at?

Simply plant the pea seeds somewhere mild and shady and make sure they receive regular water. In 2-3 months, you\u2019ll have a crop of crunchy, delectable peas that can be snacked on raw or added to your favorite wholesome recipes.\\n\\n', 'steps': [\"Sow your snap peas at the end of the cold season.:  Sugar snap peas flourish in cooler temperatures. You can put your seeds in the ground as early as the final frost of winter, just before the onset of spring. Even young plants will be hearty enough to survive one or two minor frosts in the interim.\\nThe ideal ground temperature for sugar snap peas is around 45\\xa0\u00b0F (7\\xa0\u00b0C), but you're free to begin planting as soon as the soil has thawed enough to dig.\\nDue to their preference for temperate conditions, pea plants won't do as well in warm, humid climates.\\n\", 'Find a plot of healthy soil.:  Set aside an open space in one corner of your garden where the  growing snap peas can get plenty of indirect sunlight. The soil you use for planting should be nice and dark, with a high nutrient content. It also needs to be loose enough to encourage proper drainage and runoff after a heavy rain or weekly watering.\\n\\nUse a hand aerator or similar tool to punch a series of holes in the topsoil around the pea plant. These openings will ventilate the soil.\\n', 'Add an inoculant to the soil to promote healthy growth.:  Extremely cold, nutrient-poor soil may not have the nitrogen that sugar snaps need to grow to a healthy size. You can remedy this by sprinkling a natural inoculant into the soil prior to planting. One of these compounds may also help if you notice your plants are developing at an unusually slow rate.\\nAlternatively, the seeds themselves can be dusted with an inoculant before they go into the ground.\\nInoculants are purely organic additives that can enhance a struggling plant\u2019s ability to absorb nitrogen from the soil. They can ordinarily be found wherever gardening supplies are sold.\\n', 'Make sure the peas get enough sunlight.:  Ideally, your plants should be situated somewhere where they can get about 6 hours of sun exposure per day. However, they\u2019ll also do just fine in partial shade. \\nToo much sunlight can warm the soil around the plant, resulting in unfavorable growing conditions.\\nIf you\u2019ve planted your snap peas in a separate container, you\u2019ll have the advantage of being able to move them around to areas with more or less light as needed.\\n', 'Get your hands on some sugar snap pea seeds.:  There are several different varieties of sugar snap peas, including bushing types (such as Sugar Bons, Sugar Anne, and Sugar Lace), which grow in low, leafy clusters, and larger vining types (like Sugar Daddies and the original Sugar Snap), which send up vertical stalks. Any of these species can easily be cultivated at home using the same basic cultivation methods.\\nLook for sugar snap pea cultivars at your local gardening center, greenhouse, or plant nursery.\\nIf garden space is at a premium, you might fare better with a vining type. Since these grow more upright, they\u2019ll take up less overall space.\\n', 'Plant the seeds in 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) of soil.:  Dig a shallow hole and drop in a small handful of seeds, keeping each seed about 5 inches (13\\xa0cm) apart. Press the seeds gently into the soil with the tip of your finger. Replace the soil and tamp it down lightly to compact it.\\nUse plant markers to keep track of multiple pea plants.\\n', 'Space each row of plants roughly a foot apart.:  Bushing sugar snaps will require a little breathing room, as they tend to spread out once they\u2019ve sprouted from the soil.

If you live in a hot, dry area, a weekly watering should be enough to quench the thirsty roots. When irrigating your plants, use just enough water to thoroughly wet the uppermost layer of soil without allowing it to get too soggy.\\nSnap peas don\u2019t need as much water as other types of edible crops. Your main goal should simply be to keep the soil from drying out.\\nAvoid overwatering your snap peas. Doing so can stall growth or cause more serious issues like root-rot, which could kill the plants.\\n', 'Remove pests by hand.:  A few different critters like to feed on the leaves and pods of flowering pea plants, including pea moth caterpillars, slugs, and cucumber beetles. Should you happen to spot any of these invaders on your snap peas, simply pick them off by hand. Natural insecticides like pyrethrum (preparations of pyrethrins) can also be used to control infestations without harming your plants.\\nIf you\u2019d rather not treat your plants with insecticides, try mixing fresh water with a little vegetable oil and a few drops of mild liquid detergent in a spray bottle and blast bugs whenever they pop up.\\n', 'Use compost to prevent diseases.:  While sugar snap peas are robust plants, some species are susceptible to infections like Fusarium wilt, along with rot, blights, and mildew. Covering the soil with a thick layer of organic matter and aerating it regularly should be enough to keep these conditions from occurring.\\nConsider producing your own compost using a mixture of organic waste materials like leftover fruits and vegetables, coffee grounds, eggshells, leaves, and shredded newspaper.\\nTo ward off moisture-related rot and mildew, water your peas in the first part of the day so they have a chance to dry thoroughly before the temperature drops.\\n', 'Prune your pea plants as needed.:  Be sure to remove drooping, shriveled, or overly-ripe snap peas as soon as you notice them. This will both keep the plant healthy and free up room for new pods, resulting in a more productive harvest.\\nGet in the habit of inspecting your plants every few days to check for dead and dying offshoots.\\n', \"Plan on harvesting your snap peas after 60-100 days.:  Most of the time, it takes somewhere in the neighborhood of 2-3 months for both bushing and vining varieties of snap peas to being producing edible pods. However, it's alright to begin picking them at any point, provided that the pods are fully formed. Younger plants will be delicate and tender, while more mature ones will fatten up and offer the satisfying crunch for which they're known and loved.\\nExact cultivation times may differ, depending on your climate and planting conditions. It's not uncommon for sugar snap peas to grow up to a foot per week.\\nWhen it comes to determining when your snap peas are at their peak, it's better to rely on your own judgment rather than a prescribed number.\\n\", 'Pick your snap peas when they reach their full size.:  Once the pods have grown fat and firm, pluck them from the vine by hand. A fully-grown snap pea will be somewhere between 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1\\xa0cm) long, with plump, round peas that are visible from outside the shell.\\nVining plants tend to yield more pods on average than smaller bushing ones.\\n', 'Store the snap peas in the refrigerator.:  Place the pods you\u2019ve gathered in a paper or plastic bag and stash them away in the crisper drawer or on one of the bottom shelves. When kept cool, they can last for up to two weeks. However, they\u2019ll be best when \\nAvoid storing your snap peas at room temperature.

","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Grow Sugar Snap Peas', 'description': '\\nSugar snap peas are a pea lover\u2019s dream. Unlike other varieties, which have to be shelled in order to extract the tender peas, sugar snaps can be devoured pod and all. They\u2019re also a cinch to grow, making them a favorite among horticulturalists, cooks, and casual gardeners alike. Simply plant the pea seeds somewhere mild and shady and make sure they receive regular water. In 2-3 months, you\u2019ll have a crop of crunchy, delectable peas that can be snacked on raw or added to your favorite wholesome recipes.\\n\\n', 'steps': [\"Sow your snap peas at the end of the cold season.:  Sugar snap peas flourish in cooler temperatures. You can put your seeds in the ground as early as the final frost of winter, just before the onset of spring. Even young plants will be hearty enough to survive one or two minor frosts in the interim.\\nThe ideal ground temperature for sugar snap peas is around 45\\xa0\u00b0F (7\\xa0\u00b0C), but you're free to begin planting as soon as the soil has thawed enough to dig.\\nDue to their preference for temperate conditions, pea plants won't do as well in warm, humid climates.\\n\", 'Find a plot of healthy soil.:  Set aside an open space in one corner of your garden where the  growing snap peas can get plenty of indirect sunlight. The soil you use for planting should be nice and dark, with a high nutrient content. It also needs to be loose enough to encourage proper drainage and runoff after a heavy rain or weekly watering.\\n\\nUse a hand aerator or similar tool to punch a series of holes in the topsoil around the pea plant. These openings will ventilate the soil.\\n', 'Add an inoculant to the soil to promote healthy growth.:  Extremely cold, nutrient-poor soil may not have the nitrogen that sugar snaps need to grow to a healthy size. You can remedy this by sprinkling a natural inoculant into the soil prior to planting. One of these compounds may also help if you notice your plants are developing at an unusually slow rate.\\nAlternatively, the seeds themselves can be dusted with an inoculant before they go into the ground.\\nInoculants are purely organic additives that can enhance a struggling plant\u2019s ability to absorb nitrogen from the soil. They can ordinarily be found wherever gardening supplies are sold.\\n', 'Make sure the peas get enough sunlight.:  Ideally, your plants should be situated somewhere where they can get about 6 hours of sun exposure per day. However, they\u2019ll also do just fine in partial shade. \\nToo much sunlight can warm the soil around the plant, resulting in unfavorable growing conditions.\\nIf you\u2019ve planted your snap peas in a separate container, you\u2019ll have the advantage of being able to move them around to areas with more or less light as needed.\\n', 'Get your hands on some sugar snap pea seeds.:  There are several different varieties of sugar snap peas, including bushing types (such as Sugar Bons, Sugar Anne, and Sugar Lace), which grow in low, leafy clusters, and larger vining types (like Sugar Daddies and the original Sugar Snap), which send up vertical stalks. Any of these species can easily be cultivated at home using the same basic cultivation methods.\\nLook for sugar snap pea cultivars at your local gardening center, greenhouse, or plant nursery.\\nIf garden space is at a premium, you might fare better with a vining type. Since these grow more upright, they\u2019ll take up less overall space.\\n', 'Plant the seeds in 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) of soil.:  Dig a shallow hole and drop in a small handful of seeds, keeping each seed about 5 inches (13\\xa0cm) apart. Press the seeds gently into the soil with the tip of your finger. Replace the soil and tamp it down lightly to compact it.\\nUse plant markers to keep track of multiple pea plants.\\n', 'Space each row of plants roughly a foot apart.:  Bushing sugar snaps will require a little breathing room, as they tend to spread out once they\u2019ve sprouted from the soil. With vining species, you\u2019ll be able to get away with grouping them more closely (within half a foot, or roughly 15cm)\u2014their vertical structure means the roots won\u2019t choke one another as they grow.\\nYou also have the option of planting your peas in a standalone pot. Just make sure the container is at least 12 inches (30\\xa0cm) wide by 12 inches (30\\xa0cm) deep to accommodate the expanding root system.\\n', 'Use trellises to support vining varieties.:  Without a support structure, larger plants can get top heavy and fall over, stunting their growth and creating gardening complications. A simple trellis can give the probing vines something solid to cling to and allow them to reach their full potential.\\n\\nPremade trellises can be purchased at most gardening centers and home improvement stores. They\u2019ll usually be large enough to support several plants at once.\\nEven something as simple as a tall stake or lattice will improve your vining snap peas\u2019 chances during the critical early stages of growth.\\n', 'Water your pea plants regularly, but not too much.:  For the most part, sugar snap peas are a remarkably low maintenance crop, and can get by just fine on the moisture they receive from occasional rainfall. If you live in a hot, dry area, a weekly watering should be enough to quench the thirsty roots. When irrigating your plants, use just enough water to thoroughly wet the uppermost layer of soil without allowing it to get too soggy.\\nSnap peas don\u2019t need as much water as other types of edible crops. Your main goal should simply be to keep the soil from drying out.\\nAvoid overwatering your snap peas. Doing so can stall growth or cause more serious issues like root-rot, which could kill the plants.\\n', 'Remove pests by hand.:  A few different critters like to feed on the leaves and pods of flowering pea plants, including pea moth caterpillars, slugs, and cucumber beetles. Should you happen to spot any of these invaders on your snap peas, simply pick them off by hand. Natural insecticides like pyrethrum (preparations of pyrethrins) can also be used to control infestations without harming your plants.\\nIf you\u2019d rather not treat your plants with insecticides, try mixing fresh water with a little vegetable oil and a few drops of mild liquid detergent in a spray bottle and blast bugs whenever they pop up.\\n', 'Use compost to prevent diseases.:  While sugar snap peas are robust plants, some species are susceptible to infections like Fusarium wilt, along with rot, blights, and mildew.

However, there are a few easy techniques that will keep your freshly cut hydrangeas looking great for several days.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Cut the hydrangeas in the morning when it\u2019s cooler.:  Your flowers will look fresher than if they\u2019ve been under the hot sun all day. Since the flowers are fresher, they will last longer in your arrangement.\\nIt\u2019s best to wear gloves while you cut the flowers.\\n', 'Choose only the most mature blooms.:  The larger, riper blooms will look great in your arrangement and will hold up better in the vase. This will keep your arrangement from wilting early.\\n', 'Make your cut where two stems meet.:  Follow the stems down to where they meet, then place your shears just above the joint between the two stems. Cut the stems at an angle so that they can absorb water better.\\n', 'Cut a cross-cut into the bottom of the stem so that it can take up water.:  Hydrangeas have a hard, woody stem that does not easily absorb water. Making a cross-cut into the bottom of the stem will fix this issue and allow the stem to absorb water.\\n', 'Place the cut flowers in cool water immediately.:  Stick the flowers in a temporary vase or jar while you continue cutting. This will help you preserve the cut flowers for longer, keeping your bouquet fresh.\\nFill this vase or jar ahead of time and keep it near you.\\nYou can use tap water or filtered water.\\n', 'Cut away the leaves that are under the water in your vase.:  If leaves are in the water, it will increase the bacteria growth and reduce the life of your arrangement. Once you\u2019ve gotten all of your cuttings inside your home and are ready to create the arrangement, use your sharp scissors to remove the lower leaves on the stems.\\n', 'Prune old wood hydrangeas in the early- to mid-summer.:  Old wood hydrangeas reach peak blooming in the summer. Pruning too early in the growing season will encourage your hydrangea to keep blooming. This means you would have to prune several times in the same season.\\nBe sure to prune before late summer.

Otherwise, you risk removing the buds that will bloom next year.\\n', \"Wait until fall to prune new wood hydrangeas.:  New wood hydrangeas bloom later than old wood hydrangeas because the younger stems take longer to reach blossoming. Their new buds will form in the winter, so don't prune later than the fall.\\n\", 'Avoid trimming more than one-third of the plant at one time.:  This will revitalize your plant, though you can trim less depending on your preferences. If you prune too much, it can change the shape of your hydrangeas. Hydrangeas will often grow back to their regular size, and over-trimming can result in uncontrolled growth.\\n', 'Prune faded or wilting flowers using pruning shears.:  Dull flowers can make your plant look blah, but pruning them away will allow for new growth.

This will keep your plant blooming.\\n', 'Trim weak branches and crossed branches using pruning shears.:  This will improve the look of your plant and ensure hardier growth during the next blooming season. Cut the branches where they meet another branch.\\n', 'Boil a pot of water.:  Hydrangeas produce a sap that makes it hard for them to absorb water. This means that cut flowers, if left untreated, will quickly wilt. You can solve this issue by boiling away the sap.\\nYou only need enough water to cover the ends of the flowers.\\n', 'Dip the ends of the stems in the hot water for 30 seconds.:  You can leave the boiling water in the pot while you dip the stems. Use a timer to make sure that you don\u2019t leave them in the water too long, which could damage the ends.\\nPut just the bottom .5 in (1.27 cm) of the ends into the water.\\nIf you think you damaged the ends, you can cut above the damaged part and try again.\\n', 'Plunge them into the cool water in the vase.:  The stems should immediately go into the cool water to stop the heat from continuing to affect the ends of the stems. Once they\u2019re in the vase, you can arrange the cut flowers until you like the look.\\n', 'Try alum to keep your flowers from wilting.:  As an alternative, you can dip the freshly cut ends of the stems of your flowers into the spice alum, which helps prevent the sap from clogging the stem. Cut off the tips of the stems, then dip the ends into the spice. You can then arrange the flowers as you normally would.\\n', 'Replace your water every other day.:  Fresh water will keep your flowers looking nice longer.

Hydrangeas can be a little trickier to cut since they produce a sap that makes the cut flower wilt faster. However, there are a few easy techniques that will keep your freshly cut hydrangeas looking great for several days.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Cut the hydrangeas in the morning when it\u2019s cooler.:  Your flowers will look fresher than if they\u2019ve been under the hot sun all day. Since the flowers are fresher, they will last longer in your arrangement.\\nIt\u2019s best to wear gloves while you cut the flowers.\\n', 'Choose only the most mature blooms.:  The larger, riper blooms will look great in your arrangement and will hold up better in the vase. This will keep your arrangement from wilting early.\\n', 'Make your cut where two stems meet.:  Follow the stems down to where they meet, then place your shears just above the joint between the two stems. Cut the stems at an angle so that they can absorb water better.\\n', 'Cut a cross-cut into the bottom of the stem so that it can take up water.:  Hydrangeas have a hard, woody stem that does not easily absorb water. Making a cross-cut into the bottom of the stem will fix this issue and allow the stem to absorb water.\\n', 'Place the cut flowers in cool water immediately.:  Stick the flowers in a temporary vase or jar while you continue cutting. This will help you preserve the cut flowers for longer, keeping your bouquet fresh.\\nFill this vase or jar ahead of time and keep it near you.\\nYou can use tap water or filtered water.\\n', 'Cut away the leaves that are under the water in your vase.:  If leaves are in the water, it will increase the bacteria growth and reduce the life of your arrangement. Once you\u2019ve gotten all of your cuttings inside your home and are ready to create the arrangement, use your sharp scissors to remove the lower leaves on the stems.\\n', 'Prune old wood hydrangeas in the early- to mid-summer.:  Old wood hydrangeas reach peak blooming in the summer. Pruning too early in the growing season will encourage your hydrangea to keep blooming. This means you would have to prune several times in the same season.\\nBe sure to prune before late summer. The buds that will bloom next year form in late summer or early fall, so pruning late will result in no blooms the following year.\\nIf you miss the window, wait until next year. Otherwise, you risk removing the buds that will bloom next year.\\n', \"Wait until fall to prune new wood hydrangeas.:  New wood hydrangeas bloom later than old wood hydrangeas because the younger stems take longer to reach blossoming. Their new buds will form in the winter, so don't prune later than the fall.\\n\", 'Avoid trimming more than one-third of the plant at one time.:  This will revitalize your plant, though you can trim less depending on your preferences. If you prune too much, it can change the shape of your hydrangeas. Hydrangeas will often grow back to their regular size, and over-trimming can result in uncontrolled growth.\\n', 'Prune faded or wilting flowers using pruning shears.:  Dull flowers can make your plant look blah, but pruning them away will allow for new growth. When you cut away old blooms, you encourage your plant to produce more blooms.\\nFaded or wilting flowers can be pruned at any time.\\n', 'Remove the brown, dead spots with pruning shears.:  Your plant will look better, and new growth will eventually emerge, either in this season or the next blooming season.\\nYou can prune back brown, dead spots during blooming season if you see them. This will keep your plant blooming.\\n', 'Trim weak branches and crossed branches using pruning shears.:  This will improve the look of your plant and ensure hardier growth during the next blooming season. Cut the branches where they meet another branch.\\n', 'Boil a pot of water.:  Hydrangeas produce a sap that makes it hard for them to absorb water. This means that cut flowers, if left untreated, will quickly wilt. You can solve this issue by boiling away the sap.\\nYou only need enough water to cover the ends of the flowers.\\n', 'Dip the ends of the stems in the hot water for 30 seconds.:  You can leave the boiling water in the pot while you dip the stems. Use a timer to make sure that you don\u2019t leave them in the water too long, which could damage the ends.\\nPut just the bottom .5 in (1.27 cm) of the ends into the water.\\nIf you think you damaged the ends, you can cut above the damaged part and try again.\\n', 'Plunge them into the cool water in the vase.:  The stems should immediately go into the cool water to stop the heat from continuing to affect the ends of the stems. Once they\u2019re in the vase, you can arrange the cut flowers until you like the look.\\n', 'Try alum to keep your flowers from wilting.:  As an alternative, you can dip the freshly cut ends of the stems of your flowers into the spice alum, which helps prevent the sap from clogging the stem. Cut off the tips of the stems, then dip the ends into the spice. You can then arrange the flowers as you normally would.\\n', 'Replace your water every other day.:  Fresh water will keep your flowers looking nice longer. If you leave the old water, bacteria will be able to grow, causing your flowers to wilt sooner.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Gardening gloves', 'Pruning shears', 'Sharp scissors', 'Jar or vase', 'Water', 'Pot', 'Bowl', 'Alum (optional)']}","extracted_answer":"make your cut where two stems meet","question_type":"['history']","text_question":"How much more should I cut?","question_id":"diy-235-6","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_external_fact"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-236","question":"Do they racks need to be completely dry prior to putting them back?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Clean-Oven-Racks","data_split":"test","original_answer":"YES THEY WILL NEED TO BE DRIED WITH A CLEAN TOWEL BEFORE THEY ARE PUT BACK IN THE OVEN","history":"student: Are gloves the only supplies I need for this step? | teacher: From the list of tools that is the only one you need for this yes | student: What do I do after rinsing the racks and draining the ammonia? | teacher: DRY THEM WITH A CLEAN TOWEL AND PUT THEM BACK IN THE OVEN","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Clean Oven Racks', 'description': '\\nOven racks can easily get covered in burned-on gunk, which may seem like a hassle to remove.

To overcome it, you must ascend to the top of a pair of vertical posts by hopping a free-moving bar up one rung at a time. The structure is designed to push your explosive power, upper body strength, hand-eye coordination, and endurance to the limit. Luckily, constructing a homemade version of the obstacle isn\u2019t as challenging as actually completing it. In fact, it\u2019s as simple as attaching a few angled rungs to two sturdy support posts and setting them into the ground. With a Salmon Ladder in your own backyard, you\u2019ll be able to elevate your training regimen to the next level.\\n\\n', 'steps': [\"Gather your materials.:  The Salmon Ladder has 2 main components\u20142 wooden posts and a series of angled rungs which you\u2019ll use to catch and stabilize the bar. For this project, a pair of sturdy 12\u2019-15\u2019 (3.7-4.6 m) 4x4 posts will serve as the vertical supports, with a 2x6 across the top to connect the frame. The rungs themselves will be fashioned from a 2x4 sawed to the appropriate size and shape.\\nDepending on the spacing between the rungs, two 8 foot (2.4\\xa0m) (2.4 m) long 2x4's may be needed instead of one 12 foot (3.7 m) 2x4.\\nUse only high-quality pressure-treated lumber. Since it\u2019s made to withstand heavier loads, you can be sure that it will hold up under hours and hours of intense training.\\nIn addition to the raw lumber, you\u2019ll also need a hammer or electric drill, 3\u201d (7.6 cm) nails or heavy-duty wood screws, a handsaw, a bag of quickset concrete, and a tape measure.\\n\", \"Dig holes to set the support beams.:  Use a post hole digger to clear the soil by hand quickly and ensure that the holes are uniform. Each hole should be approximately 4 feet (1.2\\xa0m) deep and 1 foot (0.30\\xa0m) across. Space them roughly 42\u201d (1 m) apart in order to leave a comfortable amount of distance to maneuver between the posts.\\nA flat, stable patch of ground with plenty of room to move around will make the best site for your Salmon Ladder.\\nIt's also a good idea to position your Salmon Ladder where you can attach other supports. This could mean resting it against a tree or adding additional supports at the top.\\nThe length of the 4x4 posts will correspond to the total height of the obstacle. For a standard 11\u2019-12\u2019 (3.4-3.7 m) ladder, you\u2019ll need to have your posts cut to 15\u2019-17\u2019 (4.6-5 m).\\n\", \"Insert the posts into the holes.:  Slide the end of the first post into one of the openings you just made and stand it upright carefully. Then, do the same with the second post. Once you've set the supports, double check that they're straight, with corners and faces perfectly aligned.\\n\\nRecruit one or -- even better -- a few assistants to help you position and hold the heavy 4x4s.\\nUse a level to make sure the posts are sitting evenly, and stretch a separate board across the two posts to test whether it sits flush.\\nIf you live in an area that receives a lot of precipitation, consider adding about 3\u201d (7.6 cm) of gravel, sand, or aggregate to the holes before setting the posts to promote drainage. Keeping the wood dry will prevent it from rotting or splitting over time.\\n\", 'Pour concrete to stabilize the posts.:  While a helper holds each post steady, shake half a bag of quickset concrete into each hole. Mix it to a consistency similar to cake batter by adding water gradually. Make sure the concrete is evenly distributed around the supports at the bottom of the holes. It should begin to set within 15-20 minutes, depending on the weather.\\nConsider setting the posts on one day, then returning to complete construction the next to give the concrete plenty of time to dry.\\nAvoid putting any weight on the Salmon Ladder until the concrete has fully hardened.\\nYou can find a blueprint for a Salmon Ladder here:\\n', 'Assemble the ladder before you place the posts in the holes.:  This will make it easier to build. After you attach all of the posts and insert the ladder into the hole, you will need to measure the top and bottom of the ladder to make sure that they are evenly spaced. Then cement the ladder.\\n\\n', 'Use the 2x6 to connect the posts.:  Saw the board to 45-46\u201d (1.1-1.2 m) so that it\u2019s just the right length to bridge the gap between the vertical supports and complete the frame, which is 42\" (1 m) wide. Line up the ends of the 2x6 with the outer edges of the posts and nail or screw it down at both ends. This piece will serve as the upper portion of the frame.\\n\\nYou\\'ll need to stand on a ladder or step stool while affixing the top piece and individual rungs.\\nBuying precut lumber will save you some time, if you don\u2019t mind paying a little extra. That way, all you\u2019ll have to do is assemble the individual pieces once you get them home.\\n', 'Mark the posts where the rungs will go.:  Your starting point on the Salmon Ladder will be decided primarily by your unique stature. You want it to be low enough to climb safely and comfortably, but not so low that you\u2019re forced to stoop or crouch to get in position. Once you\u2019ve decided on the optimal placement for the first set of rungs, space every next set 12\" (30 cm) apart.\\nA good way to determine where to put the lowest rungs is to reach up along the frame with one hand (without stretching too far) and draw a line on the side of the post.\\nMeasure and mark each set separately and use a flat board or straight edge to make sure they\u2019re evenly aligned.\\n12\u201d (30 cm) rung spacing is the official standard used for the American Ninja Warrior course, but yours can be more or less as you see fit.\\nFor beginners, 6\" (15 cm) rung spacing can be helpful for learning how to do the Salmon Ladder.\\n', 'Cut the rungs to the appropriate size and shape.:  Starting on one end of the 2x4, draw a line at a 30-35 degree angle every 12\u201d (30 cm). Saw the board along these lines to fashion the individual rungs for the ladder. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll need an even number of rungs, one for each side.\\nIf you are spacing your rungs at 6\" (15 cm), then you will need to draw your lines every 6\" (15 cm) instead of 12\" (30 cm). You should still draw them at a 30-35 degree angle.\\nYou may need additional lumber to produce a full set of rungs, depending on how high your want the obstacle to be.\\n', 'Fasten the rungs to the posts.:  Position the rungs over the marks you made earlier, and line up one of the angled ends with the backside of the frame\u2019s interior edge. Then, nail or screw the rungs into place. Install 2 opposing rungs at a time, rather than working straight up the posts, so you can check their placement as you go.\\n\\nUse multiple nails or screws to make sure the rungs are secure.\\nOnce they\u2019re attached, each rung will have a 30-35 degree incline, perfect for catching the bar as you work your way up the ladder.\\n', 'Find a suitable bar for climbing the rungs.:  A length of galvanized metal conduit piping should be strong enough to support most adult athletes without bending or warping. For lighter weight athletes, some sturdy PVC pipe might even suffice. Whatever material you go with, it\u2019s important that it be at least as long as the total distance between the posts so it will fit into place over the rungs without slipping.\\nTry hanging from the bar to see how it feels before you start training. If the material is too heavy, it will make it difficult to move quickly. If it\u2019s too light, it may be in danger of snapping after a few big jumps.\\n', 'Devise some way to break your fall.:  Sooner or later, even the most experienced athlete will miss a rung. When this happens, you\u2019ll want to have some type of protective surface in place to soften the impact in case you don\u2019t land on your feet. The simplest option is to buy a cushioned tumbling mat or an old futon and place it directly beneath the ladder. You\u2019ll then be able to focus on training and not on what might happen should you lose your grip.\\n\\nMost tumbling mats are segmented, which means they can be folded up and put away when they\u2019re not in use.\\nYou could also dig a shallow depression under the frame of your Salmon Ladder and fill it with foam blocks, sand, water, wood chips, or some other substance that will offer a little give. Create an 8\"-12\" (20-30.5 cm) deep cushion.\\n', 'Incorporate other obstacles.:  If you\u2019re planning on making your Salmon Ladder one part of a larger course, set it up so that you can make a fluid transition once you reach the top. You\u2019ll be high up off the ground, so the obstacle that comes next should be one that relies on elevation, such as a peg board, rope swing, or monkey bars.\\nDraft a blueprint for your comprehensive course before you begin building to get a sense of how each obstacle should fit together.\\nFor a true test of endurance, save the Salmon Ladder for the tail end of the course.\\n'], 'ingredients': [\"2 12'-15' (3.7-4.6 m) 4x4 posts\", \"1 10' (3 m) 2x6 board\", \"1 12' (3.7 m) 2x4 board\", 'Hammer', '3\" (7.6 cm) nails', 'Electric drill', 'Heavy-duty wood screws', 'Post hole digger', '1 bag Quick Set concrete mix', 'Water', 'Tape measure', 'Straight edge', 'Pencil or felt-tipped pen (for marking measurements)']}","extracted_answer":"make sure the concrete is evenly distributed around the supports at the bottom of the holes","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"You say that the concrete should have a consistency like cake batter.

Level floors are critical for reducing gaps between the flooring material and substrate and preventing sagging and other structural complications. If you suspect that you\u2019re working with an off-level foundation, you can get it ready for installation quickly by using a floor leveling compound.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Remove the existing flooring and check the level of the subflooring.:  Set down a 6\\xa0ft (1.8\\xa0m) level every few feet from one end of the room to the other. This will give you an idea of how much work you\u2019ve got cut out for you, and where it\u2019s needed most. A good general rule of thumb is that the foundation shouldn\u2019t slope more than \\nIf the area is very large, use a long, straight 2\\xa0in \u00d7\\xa04\\xa0in (5.1\\xa0cm \u00d7\\xa010.2\\xa0cm) board and set your level on top of it. If the floor is uneven, lift up the board until it is level so you\u2019ll know how much flooring compound you\u2019ll need to even it out.\\nFloors are rarely perfectly level. It\u2019s okay if the angle is off by a fraction of an inch in either direction.\\nKeep in mind that \u201cflat\u201d isn\u2019t the same thing as \u201clevel.\u201d Minor defects may not be noticeable to the eye, but they will be to your level.\\nIf you\u2019re installing a new floor, make a note of where the foundation should be worn down or built up.\\n', 'Sand down high spots.:  More often than not, sagging or slanted flooring materials are responsible for off-level floors. Occasionally, however, there will be humps that cause the foundation to rise above a specified height. These can be dealt with by sanding down wooden subfloors with an electric sander, or by grinding them with a motorized angle grinder.\\n\\nSanding and grinding produces a lot of dust. Be sure to wear eye protection and a facemask or ventilator while wearing down uneven subflooring.\\n', 'Clean and repair old subflooring.:  Once the subflooring is exposed and free of high spots, prepare it for the new flooring by removing any remaining dust and debris. Vacuum the entire room, especially around the corners where dust particles tend to collect. Mop concrete subfloors with diluted muriatic acid to clear away traces of oil, wax, or adhesive that may be clinging to the surface.\\nFill cracks in concrete subfloor and make sure the filled areas are level before cleaning the subfloor.\\nA thorough cleaning is also necessary to get the subflooring ready to accept the liquid bonding agent.\\n', 'Cover the subflooring with a bonding agent.:  Starting with the edges of the room along the molding, spread on a thin coat with a wide, soft-bristled paintbrush. Work your way about a foot out from each wall, then use a roller or mop to apply the bonding agent to the larger area in the center.\\nThe bonding agent will create a chemical connection with the leveling compound to help it set up more securely and last longer.\\nWear gloves, waders, and old clothing when working with liquid bonding agents and leveling compound. Once these materials get on something, they can be nearly impossible to get off.\\n', 'Mix the leveling compound to a creamy consistency.:  Most leveling compounds are sold in powdered form and just need to be combined with a little bit of water in order to be effective. Pour the powder into a 10\\xa0US\\xa0gal (38\\xa0L) bucket and begin adding room temperature water little by little until the mixture thickens to slurry. It should be about the same texture as pancake batter.\\nStir vigorously to break up lumps, but work quickly. Some compounds begin to set up in a matter of minutes.\\nAn electric drill with a mixing paddle attachment will make mixing quicker and more efficient so you can spread the compound before it hardens.\\n', 'Pour the compound over the subflooring.:  Starting in one of the far corners of the room, drizzle the wet compound into each of the sunken sections you identified while checking the level. Pour slowly to minimize splashes and splatters. The liquid will immediately seek out the lowest parts of the subfloor and fill them in.\\nTry not to over-apply the compound. In most cases, you\u2019ll only need a layer between\\nTo ensure that the finished floor turns out nice and flat, it\u2019s best to go ahead and cover the entire surface. You\u2019ll be able to chip away at what you don\u2019t need later on.\\nBe sure to work your way outward from the interior of the room, ending at the door. You don\u2019t want to accidentally trap yourself in a corner!\\n', 'Smooth out inconsistencies with a hand trowel.:  By the time you\u2019re finished pouring, the compound will have set enough to finish by hand. Spread it over the uneven foundation using long, arcing strokes, like you\u2019re frosting a giant cake. Apply a consistent amount of pressure over the entire surface.\\nFocus on lumps and contours where the different pools have dried separately and formed noticeable seams.\\nPressing down too hard on the compound while it\u2019s still wet could accidentally form depressions.\\n', 'Allow the compound to dry.:  Quick-set leveling compounds typically harden to the touch in a matter of minutes. However, it will typically take them several hours to cure completely. Check the label on the product you\u2019re working with to find out how long you can expect to wait before finishing your new level floor.\\nFor the strongest, most durable finish possible, be prepared to let the compound dry overnight.\\nConsider splitting your project up between 2 days\u2014you can pour and smooth the compound on the first, then come back and touch it up on the second once it\u2019s had a chance to set up.\\n', 'Sand the entire floor.:  Once the compound is dry, make another sweep with your electric sander to shave down slight differences in the height of the subfloor and even out rough patches. Sand from one end of the room to the other, pushing the sander along in a straight line and reversing your direction each time you reach the opposite wall.\\nWork your way from a low-grit sandpaper (around 24-40 grit) to a high-grit one (80-120 grit) to gradually smooth and blend the new surface.\\nYou may need to use a separate edge or corner sander to hit the areas closest to the walls.\\n', 'Check the level again.:  Place your level in several different spots as you did before to get a more accurate reading of the floor\u2019s overall slope.

The seeds from dates can grow into date palm trees that you\u2019ll be able to enjoy in your home, porch, or garden. Simply collect and wash the pits from some medjool dates, then let them germinate for a couple months. Once the seeds sprout, you can plant them in a pot of soil. Water them well and give them as much sunlight as possible. Date palms are slow-growing, so you may have to wait up to 4 years before they grow to full size, but the planting process is an easy way to get started!\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Buy some ripe medjool dates and collect the seeds.:  Purchase some ripe medjool dates at a grocery stores and open them up to remove the seeds from the center. Set the seeds aside and either eat or discard the date fruit.\\n\\nYou\u2019ll know the dates are ripe when they are slightly wrinkled or leaking a sticky fluid.\\n', 'Clean off the seeds to remove any leftover fruit.:  Rinse the seeds thoroughly and rub off any excess date flesh. If the leftover fruit is persistent, you can soak the seeds in hot water for 24 hours, then rub off the fruit.\\n\\n', 'Soak the pits in fresh water for 48 hours.:  Fill a cup or bowl with cool water and place the pits inside to soak. Change the water once a day by dumping out the old water and refilling it with fresh water.\\nSoaking the seed will let the seed coat absorb the water and prepare it for the germination process.\\nToss out any seeds that float to the top of the water. You only want to use seeds that sink to the bottom of the container.\\n', 'Fold 2 seeds into a damp piece of paper towel.: paper towel\\n', 'Place the seeds and paper towel into a plastic bag and seal it.:  Open up a plastic sandwich bag and tuck the damp, folded paper towel inside. Make sure the seeds are still in place before closing the bag\u2019s seal.\\n\\n', 'Store the bag in a warm, dark place for 6-8 weeks.:  The seed will germinate best at temperatures between 70 to 75\\xa0\u00b0F (21 to 24\\xa0\u00b0C). Find a place in your home that stays warm, such as the top of the refrigerator, or use a warming mat to regulate the temperature more carefully.\\n\\n', 'Check the plant regularly for growth progress or mold.: plant\\n', 'Pot:  the seed once it sprouts.\\n', 'Try sprouting the seeds in pots if you\u2019d prefer them in containers.:  Prepare one pot for each seed by filling the pots with one part seed-starting \\nThe seeds should sprout after 3-8 weeks.\\nPlace the pots on a germination mat if you\u2019re having trouble finding a spot that\u2019s 70\\xa0\u00b0F (21\\xa0\u00b0C).\\n', 'Find a pot with plenty of drainage holes in the bottom.:  Look for a clay pot or plastic container with lots of holes in the bottom for proper drainage.\\nYou should start with a smaller pot at first, but keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to transplant to a larger pot as the plant grows.\\n', 'Fill the pot 3\/5 full with potting soil.:  To estimate the soil amount, fill the pot until it reaches a little over halfway.\\nDon\u2019t pack the soil down. It will need to be loose for proper drainage.\\nYou could also add vermiculite or sand to normal potting soil in a 1:4 or 1:3 ratio.\\n', 'Place the sprouted seed 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) above the center of the soil.:  Hold the leafy or sprouted end up in center of the pot, slightly above the soil. The point where the sprout emerges should sit about an 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) below the pot\u2019s edge.\\nIf the roots are still delicate, you can plant the sprout with the paper towel to protect them.\\nOnly plant one sprouted seed per pot.\\n', 'Fill the rest of the pot up with lightly packed soil or sand.:  Hold the seed and sprout in place while you add the rest of the soil, filling it to the point where the sprout emerges. Pat the soil down to lightly pack it so the sprout will have support to stand up.\\n\\n', 'Water the plant thoroughly.:  After being planted, the sprout will need a good drink. Pour \\n', 'Keep the pot in a sunny area.:  Some good spots are near a window with lots of sun or on an open porch. The plant will grow best in full sunlight, so try to keep it exposed as much as possible.\\n', 'Water the plant whenever the first 2 inches (5.1\\xa0cm) of soil feels dry.:  Check the soil daily by sticking your pointer finger into the dirt up to the second knuckle. If the dirt feels moist, then the plant still has enough moisture and you should wait to water it. If the soil feels dry, pour some water over evenly over the dirt\u2019s surface.\\nIt\u2019s better to water plants when they need it, rather than on a set schedule.\\n', 'Transplant the date palm into larger pots as it grows.:  Once you notice that the plant is outgrowing its current pot or growing roots out of the bottom of the pot, you\u2019ll need to move it to a bigger pot. Keep doing this throughout the plant\u2019s life as it keeps growing. Always water the plant well before and after transplanting it into a new pot.\\nOnce the plant has grown to tree size, you can move the large pot outdoors onto a deck or porch. Make sure to keep it in a spot with maximum sun exposure.\\nIf necessary, you can also keep it indoors in a large pot near a sunny window. However, keep in mind that this will severely hinder its growth.\\nIf you live in a warm enough climate, you can also transplant the date palm into the ground outside.\\n', 'Transplant the date palm into the ground if it gets too big for a pot.:  As long as you live in a warm enough climate, you can move your date palm plant outdoors and plant it in the ground. You\u2019ll need to choose a sunny spot and dig a hole large enough to hold the plant\u2019s roots. Take the plant out of its pot and set it in the hole, then fill it in with soil.\\nKeep in mind that over time, date palms can reach heights of 50 feet (15\\xa0m).

Though curb rash is unsightly, you can fix it yourself with time, patience, and dedication.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Put on protective gear.:  You\u2019ll be sanding, using putty, priming, painting, and clear coating to complete this project! It\u2019s important to wear eye protection, gloves, and a mask when working with paint thinner, sandpaper, primer, or paint.\\n', 'Sand the scuffed areas with 400-grit sandpaper.:  Use 400-grit sandpaper to even out the metal in the damaged area. Don\u2019t go much beyond the damaged area\u2014there\u2019s no need to do more work than necessary. Keep sanding until the damage is smoothed out.\\n', 'Apply spot putty to the scuffed areas and let it dry.:  Any kind of automotive spot putty will work. Squeeze a small amount of the product onto a putty knife and use it to fill in the damaged area. Aim to cover the area in a very thin layer. Then, let the putty dry, which typically only takes about 30 minutes.\\n', 'Sand the excess putty away with 400-grit sandpaper.:  Once the putty is dry, you can sand away the excess. Use 400-grit sandpaper to smooth out the putty until it is even and level with the rest of the rim.\\n', 'Add more putty and sand the area again, if necessary.:  If the damage is deep or you sanded too much of the putty away, you can add more. Use the same technique as before and be sure to let the putty dry before you sand the second layer.\\n\\n', 'Use a scouring pad to remove the clear coat from the rest of the rim.:  Though you could try to exactly match the paint to the color of your rims, it would be a very difficult task. It\u2019s better to repaint the entire rim so it is a single, solid color. For the paint to adhere, the surface can\u2019t be shiny. Use a scouring pad to scuff up the entire rim until it has a matte finish.\\n', 'Clean the rims with paint thinner.:  It\u2019s important to clean the rims before moving forward so that the primer and paint will adhere well to the metal. Put a small amount of paint thinner on a lint-free cloth and use it to wipe down the rims.\\n', 'Mask the entire car so only the damaged rims are showing.:  Mask off the valve stem, lug nuts, and center cap of the tire. Stuff masking paper or plastic into the holes in the rims to cover the brake pads, too. Put masking tape behind the rim to cover and protect the tires. Then, cover your entire car with masking paper or a drop cloth. Secure all seams with masking tape so that only the damaged rim is showing and the rest of the tire and car is masked.\\nSpraying the primer and paint can ruin the rest of your car if you don\u2019t mask it properly, so take your time with this step!\\nAlternatively, you could remove the tires from the car so you only have to mask the tire, valve stems, lug nuts, center cap, and brake pads.\\n', 'Spray the primer over the entire rim.:  Shake the can of primer thoroughly before using it. Hold the can about 6 inches (15\\xa0cm) from the rim. Then, spray the entire rim using short back-and-forth motions. Work from the top of the rim down to the bottom. Aim to cover the rim in a thin, even layer.\\n', 'Allow the primer to dry, then apply a second coat if desired.:  The primer should only take about 10-15 minutes to dry. If your first coat is too thin or is uneven, you can apply a second coat using the same method as before. Let it dry for at least 15 minutes before painting over the primer.\\n', 'Apply a thin layer of paint to the rim.:  Before you spray the paint, shake the paint can thoroughly. Spray the paint in a thin, even layer over the entire rim. Don\u2019t hold the can too close to the rim\u2014it should be about 6 inches (15\\xa0cm) away. Use short strokes and a back-and-forth motion. Start at the top of the rim and work toward the bottom.\\nChoose a paint color that is as close to the original color of the rims as possible.\\n', 'Apply a second layer of paint after 30 minutes, if necessary.:  If the paint is uneven or sheer, you can apply another coat. Wait 30 minutes for the first coat to dry, then add another coat using the same method as before.\\n', 'Let the paint dry for 2-12 hours.:  For best results, you should allow the paint to dry thoroughly before moving on. If possible, let the paint dry overnight so it is completely set. If you\u2019re in a big hurry, allow the paint to dry for at least 2 hours before adding the clear coat.\\n', 'Spray a thin layer of clear coat over the rims.:  Shake the can before beginning, and hold it about 6 inches (15\\xa0cm) away from the rim. Apply a very thin layer! If you spray too much, it will drip, run, and ruin the look of your rims. Again, work your way from the top of the rim to the bottom, using short back-and-forth strokes.\\n', 'Let the clear coat dry for 30 minutes, then add another layer.:  Avoid touching the rim to see if it\u2019s dry, which could smudge the finish. Instead, wait 30 minutes before adding the second layer. Take your time when spraying the clear coat so that the entire rim is evenly coated.\\n', 'Allow the clear coat dry for 12-24 hours.:  It\u2019s best to let the clear coat dry fully before moving on. If the clear coat isn\u2019t dry, you could ruin the finish and have the start the entire project over. If you can\u2019t wait 24 hours, wait at least 12 hours before removing the masking tape.\\n', 'Remove the masking tape and replace the center cap.:  Once the clear coat is completely dry, you can remove the masking tape and the masking paper or drop cloths. Don\u2019t forget to replace the center cap as well.\\n', 'Polish the rims to restore their shine.:  Pick up rim polish from your local auto parts store. Apply it according to the package directions.

Pruning yucca plants is a quick and simple process. Remove unwanted leaves from both indoor and outdoor plants, or shorten your potted yuccas. While pruning is not required for yucca plants, it helps the plant stay in great health all year.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Cut off the lower leaves with a blade if you want to remove its \"skirt.\":  The bottom leaves are called the yucca\u2019s \u201cskirt.\u201d Start at the bottom of the plant, and begin cutting off leaves using a knife, blade, pruning shears, or scissors. Make your cuts as close as possible to the yucca\\'s trunk. Stop removing leaves about halfway up the tree or when you like the way the yucca looks.\\nYou can cut these leaves away as desired. Keep in mind the best time to prune yuccas is in the early spring, so you can also choose to trim your plants then if you\\'d like.\\nYucca plants develop a \u201cskirt\u201d of lower leaves much like palms trees.\\nCutting away damaged leaves is especially helpful if the yucca plant is struggling. Removing the leaves will bring the plant back to health.\\n', 'Leave the yucca\u2019s leaves in place if you prefer a \"skirted\" tree look.:  Let the lower leaves naturally fall off rather than pruning them if you\\'d like. The lower leaves will not harm the plant if you keep them on, and you may like the way this looks better than a trimmed yucca plant.\\nCosmetic pruning is mostly based on personal preference.\\nYou can still cut away damaged or dying leaves. They may naturally fall off, but this will help maintain the plant\\'s health.\\n', 'Cut the flower stalk to about 4 inches (10\\xa0cm) above its base.:  Do this after the yucca plant blooms. When yucca plants bloom, white flowers grow from the top center of the plant. Grasp the flower stalk, move the leaves out of the way, and make your cuts with either pruning shears, a sharp knife, or a pair of scissors.\\nYou may prune before the plant blooms, though yucca trees are most commonly pruned after they bloom. Once they bloom, you can cut them immediately or wait for the flowers to fade.\\n', 'Pick up and dispose of your trimmings when you are finished.:  Throw out the leaves or use them for compost. The yucca tree will look beautiful with its new haircut!\\n', \"Cut yuccas when they outgrow their pot or to replant in smaller pots.:  You can cut the plant into 2 separate sections and replant both of them. The plants will sprout and grow new leaves starting from the cut point.\\nYou can tell your plant has outgrown its pot when the root is not far from the outer edge of your pot.\\nYou can also transplant the plant into a larger pot if you don't want to cut it.\\nYou essentially get an additional plant for free if you cut them and replant both!\\n\", 'Prune the yucca trees in the spring just before their growth period.:  Yucca plants will flower in the springtime. It is best to prune them in early spring, right before they flower. \\nPruning the trees helps promote and control their growth.\\n', 'Remove tall yucca plants from their containers.:  Pick which plants you want to prune, based on height and size. You can do this for 1 plant or a few. Grasp the tree\u2019s trunk, and pull it out of the container firmly.\\n', 'Locate the halfway mark on the tree and remove the bottom leaves.:  Look at the tree and make a mental note of a spot mid-way between the tree\u2019s trunk and the first leaf cluster. This is your halfway mark. To make it easier to cut your trunk, rip off the leaves or cut them with a sharp blade.\\nThe halfway mark can be a rough estimate rather than an exact measurement.\\n', 'Cut the trunk at your halfway mark using a hand saw or sharp blade.:  Use a pair of scissors or a sharp knife to cut small trees (about 1\u20137\\xa0in (2.5\u201317.8\\xa0cm) in diameter), or use a hand saw to slice large trunks (about 10\\xa0in (25\\xa0cm) or larger in diameter). Push your tool into the yucca\u2019s trunk with consistent, steady pressure.\\nYour trunk will easily slice in half with a moderate amount of force.\\n', 'Leave both yucca halves in the sun for 1-3 hours before replanting.:  You can replant both sections of your tree after you trim it, but first place your trimmed trunks in a sunny, airy spot outside. Your trunk will better take to the soil if you leave it in the open air for a few hours.\\nSet the halves on the sidewalk, in the grass, or on a table.\\n', \"Purchase a pot that fits the tree's roots if replanting in a container.:  Consider the size of the yucca plant as you look for a pot. You want to make sure the plant is stable and will not tip over.\\nPurchase a container at a home and garden store.\\nYour pot should easily fit the roots of your plant and have some extra room for it to grow.\\n\", \"Pick a sunny spot to rehome the yucca either inside or outdoors.:  Choose a location where the plant will get direct sunlight for most of the day. Yuccas grow best under full sunlight. Choose a spot for your potted plants, like near a window. You can also plan a spot for your outdoor yucca plant, like as a focal point in your lawn.\\nYucca plants can live in all seasons and many climate zones. They are native to warm, dry areas, but many species adapt well to urban environments and cold climates.\\nYucca leaves are sharp. Keep the yucca plant away from sidewalks and high traffic areas so they don't cut anyone. If you have children or pets, pick a location away from their play area.\\nIf the yucca tree does not receive enough sunlight, the leaves will start to stretch and look wilted.\\n\", 'Dig a hole 2 times as deep and wide as the roots if replanting outside.:  To replant the yucca, grab a shovel and dig a hole in your lawn. The size of your hole will vary depending on the size of the tree. Make sure it is deep enough to fit your tree\u2019s roots.\\n', 'Fill 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6\\xa0cm) of your pot or hole with gravel and soil.:  Yucca plants can get damaged by over-watering, so it is important to keep your soil well-drained by using gravel. Pour gravel into your container or hole first, then sprinkle in a few inches of potting soil.\\nPurchase gravel and potting soil at a home supply or garden store. Make sure you use well-draining potting soil. Consider using cacti and palm soil blends, though they are not required.\\nYou can use sand as an alternative to help maintain soil drainage.\\n', 'Place the tree inside its new home and fill its pot or hole with soil.:  Press down on the soil to get rid of any air pockets.\\nMake sure the plant is straight and centered in its new pot.\\n', 'Water the plant lightly for about 10 seconds with a hose or watering can.:  Watering the plants will help the roots take to their new soil. Yucca plants do not need much water, so lightly cover the base of the plant for a few seconds.\\nWater your plants again in about 10 days to 2 weeks. Touch the soil on top to determine when it needs to be watered. If the top 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1\\xa0cm) feel dry, lightly water the plants.\\nYucca plants will shrivel and wrinkle if they do not get enough water. If over-watered, the leaves will die or become discolored.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Protecting gloves', 'Long-sleeved clothing', 'Safety glasses', 'Sharp blade, scissors, or hand pruners.', 'Potting soil', 'Gravel (or sand)', 'Pot (optional)', 'Hand saw (optional)']}","extracted_answer":"get an additional plant for free if you cut them and replant both","question_type":"['confirmation']","text_question":"I'm to cut the plant in half at the trunk?

These mats are meant to last for 25-40 uses, but cleaning them can extend their life. To clean your mat and rejuvenate its stickiness, you can do light cleaning often and deeper cleaning when the mat has gotten excessively dirty.[1]\\nX\\nExpert Source\\n\\nSarah StearnsDIY Specialist\\nExpert Interview.  4 October 2021.\\n\\n After cleaning no longer makes the mat sticky again, there are also ways to add a new layer of stickiness.\\n\\n', 'steps': [\"Give your mat a light cleaning when it loses some of its stickiness.:  In order to keep your mat sticky for as long as possible, it's a good idea to clean it regularly. First scrape it off with a plastic scraper, either Cricut brand or any other type of hard plastic scraper. Then wipe an alcohol-free baby wipe or roll a lint roller over the surface.\\nA lint roller is usually stickier than the mat, so it's able to remove any debris that is stuck to the mat.\\nThe baby wipes are able to gently wet down the surface and remove debris without damaging the mat.\\n\", 'Rub the surface with soap and water.:  If you have used your mat repeatedly and it is really lacking stickiness, the surface may need a light scrub. Put a small amount of dish soap and warm water over the surface and scrub it lightly with a soft brush. Then rinse the surface off with warm water.\\nIf you want to use a sponge on the surface, try a Magic Eraser. This type of sponge will be gentle enough on the surface and it is good at removing residue.\\n', 'Spray a degreaser on the mat.:  If your mat is very dirty and has no stickiness left, you will need to use a stronger cleaner. Degreasers will cut through whatever is on the surface and remove it. However, they can leave a residue, so the mat needs to be cleaned with soap and water after using a degreaser.\\n\\nUsing a strong degreaser may diminish the stickiness of the mat. However, you can replenish the stickiness after it is clean and dry.\\n', \"Let the mat air dry.:  Once clean, put the mat on a drying rack or hang it up so that both sides of it are able to dry completely. Whatever type of cleaning you do, it's important to let the mat dry before using it in the machine again.\\n\\nAny remaining moisture will minimize its stickiness and could damage the machine.\\nDo not use a towel to dry the mat. Rubbing a towel over the sticky surface will cover it with fibers, minimizing its effectiveness.\\n\", 'Remove all frosting, fondant, or gum paste.:  There are some Cricut machines that are made specifically to cut decorative pieces out of gum paste, frosting sheets, and fondant. Once the decorative pieces have been cut and pulled off the mat, you will need to remove all excess gum paste, frosting, or fondant by pulling it off the mat with your fingers.\\n\\nIn some cases, the excess can be reconstituted and reused.\\n', 'Scrape off excess shortening with a plastic scraper.:  The decorative food sheets cut with these special Cricut machines are held on to the cutting mat with a thick layer of shortening, not a sticky mat. Once you are done cutting a sheet, scrape as much of this shortening off as possible. \\n\\nCricut sells plastic scrapers that can be used on their mats. However, any small plastic scraper, such as those sold for cleaning dishes, will work.\\n', 'Use warm soapy water to clean the mat.:  Once you cover the mat in dish soap and warm water, scrub it to remove the excess shortening. You may need to scrub the surface of the mat a bit with a normal dish sponge or brush to remove any excess shortening.\\n\\nYou should only use cleaners on it that are non-toxic and safe for contact with kitchen equipment, so using warm water and dish soap works well on these mats.\\n', \"Let the mat air dry.:  Like all other Cricut mats, the Cricut Cake mats should be left out to dry after they are washed. Once completely dry, they can be used again in your machine.\\n\\nDon't use a towel to dry your mat. This can leave fibers on the surface of the mat, which will be transferred to the frosting, fondant, or gum paste you cut.\\n\", \"Remove the original sticky layer with rubbing alcohol or stickiness remover.:  To get new adhesive to stick to your mat, it's a good idea to remove the layer that has lost its stickiness. You can do this by covering the surface with rubbing alcohol or a stickiness removing product, such as Goo Gone.\\nYou may need to use a scrapper, such as the one included in the Cricut tools pack, to get the old surface to come off.\\n\", \"Tape off the edges of the mat.:  The edges of a Cricut mat need to be free of stickiness, as this is the part of the mat that is pulled through the machine's rollers. To ensure that you don't get any adhesive on these areas, you should tape them off with painter's tape or masking tape.\\n\\nThe area that you need to tape off is clearly marked on the mat with color. The colored areas are on all 4 edges outside of the grid pattern.\\n\", 'Cover the surface with a repositionable adhesive.:  There are a variety of adhesive products that people use to rejuvenate their mats. They are available at craft stores and from online retailers. Some can be sprayed over the surface and some need to be brushed on, but all should be applied in 2-3 coats. Some adhesives that work well include:\\n\\nRepositionable scrapbooking glue\\nRepositionable glue sticks\\nQuilt basting spray\\nTacky glue thinned out with an equal part of water\\nRepositionable spray adhesive\\n', \"Let the adhesive dry thoroughly.:  This will ensure that the adhesive is bonded to the mat properly and that it doesn't stick too much to the paper you are cutting. Once the mat is dry, remove the tape and use the mat.\\n\\n\"], 'ingredients': ['Plastic scraper', 'Alcohol-free baby wipe', 'Lint roller', 'Dish soap', 'Magic eraser', 'Degreaser', 'Plastic scraper', 'Dish soap', 'Sponge', 'Dish brush', 'Rubbing alcohol', 'Stickiness remover', 'Plastic scraper', \"Painter's tape or masking tape\", 'Repositionable adhesive']}","extracted_answer":"use cleaners on it that are non-toxic and safe for contact with kitchen equipment","question_type":"['confirmation']","text_question":"Is the degreaser toxic at all to handle?","question_id":"diy-255-3","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-258","question":"What is the recommended measurement I should get when I use the soil tester?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Plant-Forget-Me-Not-Seeds","data_split":"test","original_answer":"PH 5.5-7.5 TESTER","history":"student: Alright, I think I got a good spot picked out to plant it.

Armed with this information, you should be able to find the perfect vinyl plank flooring for your home!\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Opt for a thickness of 2\u20133\\xa0mm (0.079\u20130.118\\xa0in) for low-traffic areas.:  If you\u2019re covering a small area with low traffic, you can choose planks in a thickness of 2\\xa0mm (0.079\\xa0in), 2.5\\xa0mm (0.098\\xa0in), or 3\\xa0mm (0.12\\xa0in).\\nThinner vinyl planks are usually more budget-friendly, making this an inexpensive way to freshen up the look of a smaller room!\\nThin vinyl can\u2019t hide imperfections in your subfloor, so you\u2019ll need to have an even concrete subfloor.\\n', 'Select planks between 3.2\u20134.0\\xa0mm (0.13\u20130.16\\xa0in) for high-traffic areas.:  Most of the common areas in your home, including the living room and the kitchen, will be best suited by a high-quality plank that is either 3.2\\xa0mm (0.13\\xa0in) or 4\\xa0mm (0.16\\xa0in) thick.\\nThis thickness is a good balance of durability and affordability. In addition, it will have a somewhat soft feel beneath your feet, providing additional comfort in living areas.\\n', 'Choose a thickness of 5\\xa0mm (0.20\\xa0in) or more for the highest quality.:  The thickest vinyl planks can be anywhere from 5\\xa0mm (0.20\\xa0in) to over 8\\xa0mm (0.31\\xa0in) thick. These planks cost the most, but they are also the most durable and usually look the most like real wood.\\nThicker vinyl is a good option if you have a thin or uneven hardwood subfloor, since it will smooth out imperfections.\\n', 'Select a vinyl no-wax top coat for the most affordable wear layer.:  The top layer of your vinyl flooring, or the wear layer, is what determines how durable the flooring is. A no-wax coating is made from urethane or vinyl. It\u2019s the most affordable option, but it is the least durable.\\nYou will need to apply a new protective coating every 2-3 years as it wears off over time.\\nThese coatings come in a variety of thicknesses and budget options.\\n', 'Pick an enhanced urethane coating for the most durability.:  These coatings are made from advanced materials such as aluminum oxide, and they will provide the greatest protection against everyday wear.\\nEnhanced urethane coatings will cost more, but they will prolong the life of your flooring.\\n', 'Choose a wear layer of 10 mil (0.01 in) or more for most family areas.:  You can find vinyl planks with wear layers starting at as little as 2 mil (0.002 in), but these will wear out quickly. Planks with a wear layer of 10 mil (0.01 in) are considered to be appropriately durable for use in moderate-to-high traffic\\xa0areas of your home.\\n', 'Opt for a 20 mil wear layer for commercial spaces.:  If you are going to be installing your vinyl plank flooring in an area with high foot traffic, such as a restaurant or retail space, choose flooring with a wear layer of at least 20 mil (0.02 in).\\n\\nThis will ensure that your flooring is sufficiently durable to last for several years.\\n', 'Choose printed vinyl for the most affordable color patterns.:  Printed vinyl is more affordable because the color or pattern is printed directly onto the vinyl, then covered with a clear coat.\\nThis type of flooring shows scratches more easily, and it looks the least like real wood, but since it\u2019s economical, it\u2019s a good choice if you\u2019re covering large areas.\\n', 'Select inlaid vinyl to get the look of real wood.:  Inlaid vinyl is made so that the color penetrates the entire floor, which means it won\u2019t dull or scratch as easily as printed vinyl.\\nInlaid vinyl costs slightly more, but it will retain its new look longer than printed vinyl.\\n', 'Pick glued planks if you want a permanent installation option.:  Glued vinyl planks are adhered directly to the subfloor. This is the best option for high traffic areas, as it will be resistant to peeling or slipping.\\nBecause it\u2019s difficult to remove glued flooring once it\u2019s installed, you may want to have a professional install these floors.\\n', 'Opt for floating planks for an easy DIY installation.:  Floating planks snap together similar to tongue-and-groove wood planks. These are a popular option for people who want to install their new flooring themselves.\\n\\nFloating planks are not adhered to the floor, so they can be easily removed with a crowbar if you decide you want to change things up in a few years.\\n', 'Avoid wide planks unless your subfloor is perfectly even.:  Most vinyl planks are about 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315\\xa0cm) wide, but you can find options up to 11 inches (28\\xa0cm) wide. However, wide planks will not sit correctly unless your subfloor is completely level. \\nIf you have a hardwood subfloor, you should opt for standard-width planks.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"consider the thickness of the vinyl, the wear layer, and the installation method","question_type":"['complex']","text_question":"Okay.

Old can or soda bottles can work, or even another smaller pot turned upside down. ","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Fill a Tall Planter', 'description': '\\nTall planters filled with flowers or plants can look gorgeous on your porch, patio, in your yard, or indoors. Using all soil to fill the planter is extremely heavy, costly, and can lead to drainage problems for your plants; plus, most plants just don\u2019t need that much soil. You can fill your planter about halfway with another filler material, then put your soil and plant on top, to save money and make it easy to move your tall planter around as you like.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Use collected soda bottles or cans for a low-cost, long-lasting option.:  If you drink lots of soda or bottled water, this option may be perfect for you. Collect the bottles or cans until you have enough to fill about 1\/3 to half of your tall planter. Leave the caps on the plastic bottles, and avoid crushing the aluminum cans too much if you\u2019re using those.\\nIf you use this option, you\u2019ll also want to have a layer of newspaper, landscaping fabric, or cheesecloth available to lay down on top of your bottles or cans before adding your soil.\\n', 'Try a smaller inverted pot if you have an extra one.:  Choose a pot that fits easily into the center of your tall planter. Be sure that this pot has its own drainage holes, or add some to it by drilling them in.\\nIf your large planter has drainage holes along the bottom edges, avoid blocking them with the top edges of your smaller pot. You\u2019ll need to be sure that water can still drain through the bottom of your planter.\\nIf your smaller pot is significantly smaller than your larger planter, you\u2019ll want to hold it in place with another material like clay pebbles or wood chips. This will also help to lessen the amount of soil you\u2019ll need when filling your planter.\\n', 'Stand a tall, rectangular wood beam into your planter for a simple choice.:  Scrap 4x4 or 6x6 pieces of wood also work well for filling the bottom of your tall planter. Choose a piece that easily stands up in the center of the bottom of your planter. Using a saw, cut the wood so that it\u2019s about half the height of your planter.\\nAvoid this option if the drainage holes of your tall planter are in the middle of your planter\u2019s bottom. The wood will cover the holes and not allow your soil to drain properly.\\nYou can use wood chips, clay pebbles, or soil to hold the wood beam in place in the center of your planter.\\n', 'Use rocks or broken crockery for a sturdy option.:  This option is a bit heavier, but still works well to defray costs when buying your topsoil. Collect enough rocks or broken pots to fill about 1\/3 to half of your tall planter.\\nThis option works well if your tall planter becomes narrower at the bottom and you\u2019re concerned about it tipping over from the weight of your soil and plant at the top.\\nBe sure that your rocks are not covering any drainage holes in the bottom of your planter.\\n', 'Choose wood chip mulch or pinecones as a lightweight choice.:  Collect enough pinecones to fill 1\/3 to half of your tall planter, or purchase wood chip mulch at your local hardware store. If you use this option, you\u2019ll want to be sure to check the filler each year when you change soil to make sure the wood hasn\u2019t started rotting.\\n', 'Use Styrofoam packing peanuts if you have them.:  If you have some packaging peanuts lying around, test them out to make sure they don\u2019t dissolve in water. Place some in a bowl of water and check to see if they shrink or dissolve. If they don\u2019t, you can use these to fill 1\/3 to half of your tall planter for a planter that\u2019s nice and light.\\n\\nUse mesh onion bags to hold the packing peanuts in place and avoid making a mess when you replace your plant\u2019s topsoil each year.\\nYou can also try cutting up larger pieces of Styrofoam packaging and filling your planter with these pieces.\\n', 'Try plastic Easter eggs, milk jugs, or containers as a long-lasting choice.:  Plastic is light and lasts a long time, so any plastic items that fit into the bottom of your planter are a nice choice. Use intact Easter eggs, keep lids on milk jugs, and keep the lids on containers if you\u2019re using those. This will keep most of the bottom of your planter filled with air, and allow for good drainage from the soil above.\\nIf you\u2019re using jugs or containers, be sure not to block any of the drainage holes in the bottom of your planter. Space the jugs or containers out so they\u2019re not blocking the holes.\\n', 'Drill drainage holes if the planter doesn\u2019t already have some.:  Your planter should come with drainage holes at the bottom, but if it doesn\u2019t, be sure to create some using a drill. Turn the planter over so the bottom is facing up, and use a power drill to make holes along the outside edges of the bottom of the pot.\\n6-8 holes should be enough for most tall planters, but you can make more if your planter is wide or it seems like it could use more.\\nAlways use eye protection and gloves when using power tools.\\n', 'Fill your planter 1\/3 to half full with your filler material.:  Use whatever filler material you\u2019ve chosen to fill your planter 1\/3 to half full. Some people choose to measure the depth of their plants instead, and subtract that number from the height of the planter to determine how much filler they need. This is fine too, especially if you\u2019re using the planter for a plant that requires very little soil.\\nFor example, if your planter is 21 inches (53\\xa0cm) tall, and the soil of your plant is about 7 inches (18\\xa0cm) deep, you can either fill the bottom remaining 14 inches (36\\xa0cm) with filler, or fill the bottom 10.5 inches (27\\xa0cm), which is half the planter, depending on your preference.\\n', 'Surround the filler material with clay pebbles if needed.:  Certain fillers, like inverted pots or standing wood beams, may need extra support to hold them in place. Clay pebbles for plants are a good option for this, since they provide good drainage and are a bit lighter than wet soil. You can find clay pebbles at most hardware or home improvement stores in the garden\/patio section.\\nYou also have the option of using wood chips instead of clay pebbles. These will need to be replaced each year because water can cause them to rot.\\n', 'Add a layer of topsoil to your planter.:  Once you have your filler in place, put a 2 inches (5.1\\xa0cm) layer down on top of it, or more if your plant is somewhat shallow. If you used cans, bottles, or other plastic items as your filler, you should add a layer of newspaper, landscaping fabric, or cheesecloth between the filler and soil to prevent too much soil from falling down into the bottom of your planter.\\n', 'Remove your plant or flower from its original pot.:  Carefully tip the pot of the plant you\u2019re using in the planter to loosen the soil from the inside of its original pot. Doing this when your plant\u2019s soil is wet works best because the soil will stay together better. Remove the entire plant with its roots and soil all together.\\n', 'Set the whole plant with its original soil into the center of your planter.:  You want to try to keep the roots of your plant the way they are as much as possible to avoid damaging them. Once they\u2019re settled into your planter, they will start to take up more space, but for now, don\u2019t spread them out. Simply set the whole plant with roots and soil into your new planter.\\nOn the other hand, if the plant appears to be root-bound in its current container, loosen the roots gently outwards with your fingers. A root-bound plant will have visible roots that coil around the inside of the pot.\\n', 'Fill the surrounding space with topsoil.:  Unless your plant with its original soil is wide enough to fill your tall planter to its edges, you\u2019ll need to fill in the remaining space with topsoil. Make a nice smooth top  layer of soil at the base of the plant, and give your plant some extra soil around its base if it lost any in the transplant.\\n', 'Change the topsoil and check on your filler each year.:  Many potted plants do well when their soil is changed each year, so they get new nutrients. You can discard the old soil from your planter into other parts of your garden, and use a new bag of topsoil to replace it. When you\u2019re replacing the soil, peek down into your bottom filler to see if it needs to be replaced.\\n\\nChange your bottom filler if you used wood and it\u2019s starting to rot, or become squishy and smelly; and change out aluminum cans if they are starting to rust.\\nPlastic items and Styrofoam generally last a long time, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to check on them and see if they are breaking down and could be replaced. Rocks, broken pottery, and clay pebbles will be the materials that last the longest out of your bottom fillers.\\n', 'Mix in compost or soil amendments instead of replacing your topsoil.:  As an alternative to replacing the top soil completely, you can also just mix compost, leaf mold, manure, peat moss, gypsum, or other soil amendments into the soil. This works best if you originally started with healthy or living soil instead of premixed potting soil.\\n\\nIf you used a mix like Miracle-Gro, it is likelier that you will need to replace the soil every year. Consider replacing it with living or organic soil.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Filler of your choice', 'Power drill if your tall planter doesn\u2019t come with drainage holes', 'Eye protection and gloves if you\u2019re using a power drill', 'Bags of topsoil', 'Plant(s) of your choice']}","extracted_answer":"be sure to check the filler each year when you change soil to make sure the wood hasn\u2019t started rotting","question_type":"['complex']","text_question":"I want to put a small pot into the planter.
