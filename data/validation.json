Many individuals are not aware that a simple potted plant is literally the meaning of Bonsai, \"Potted Plant.\"\\nThere are however a large pool of types of plants, bushes and even trees that can be trained and kept as a Bonsai.\\nThough usually associated with Japan, Bonsai tree cultivation actually originated in China, where the trees eventually came to be associated with the religion of Zen Buddhism. Bonsai trees are now used for decorative and recreational purposes in addition to their traditional uses. Caring for bonsai trees gives the cultivator a chance to take a contemplative yet creative role in the growth of an emblem of natural beauty.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Select a suitable species of tree for your climate.:  Not all Bonsai trees are the same. Many woody perennials and even some tropical plants can be made into Bonsai trees, but not every species will be appropriate for your unique location. When selecting a species, it\\'s important to consider the climate that the tree will be grown in. For instance, some trees die in freezing weather, while others actually \\nOne particularly beginner-friendly variety of Bonsai tree is the juniper. These evergreens are hardy, surviving all across the northern hemisphere and even in the more temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. In addition, juniper trees are easy to raise - they respond well to pruning and other \"training\" efforts and, because they are evergreens, never lose their leaves. They are rather slow growing, however.\\nOther conifers commonly cultivated as Bonsai trees include pines, spruces, and cedars of many varieties. Deciduous (leafy) trees are another possibility - Japanese maples are especially beautiful, as are magnolias, elms, and oaks. Finally, some non-woody tropical plants, like jade and \"snowrose\", are good choices for indoor environments in cool or temperate climates.\\n', \"Decide whether you plan on having an indoor or outdoor tree.:  The needs of indoor and outdoor Bonsai trees can vary drastically. Generally, indoor environments are drier and receive less light than outdoor environments, so you'll want to choose trees with lower light and moisture requirements. Below are listed some of the most common varieties of bonsai tree, grouped by their appropriateness for either indoor or outdoor environments:\\n\\n\\n\\nNote that temperate species require winter dormancy or the tree will eventually die. They cannot be grown indoors for long periods of time.\\n\", \"Select the size of your bonsai.:  Bonsai trees come in a wide variety of sizes. Full-grown trees can be as small as 6 inches (15.2\\xa0cm) tall  to as large 3 feet (0.9\\xa0m) tall, depending on their species. If you're choosing to grow your Bonsai tree from a seedling or a cutting from another tree, they can start off even smaller. Larger plants require more water, soil, and sunlight, so make sure that you have all the necessary amenities before making your purchase.\\n\\nJust a few things you'll want to consider when deciding on the size of your Bonsai tree:\\nThe size of the container you'll be using\\nThe space you have available at your home or office\\nThe availability of sunlight at your home or office\\nThe amount of care you'll be able to invest in your tree (larger trees take longer to prune)\\n\", \"Visualize the finished product while selecting a plant.:   Once you have decided which kind and what size of Bonsai you would like, you can go to a nursery or a bonsai shop and select the plant that will become your bonsai tree. When choosing a plant, look for a vibrant, healthy green leaf or needle color to make sure that the plant is healthy (however, keep in mind that deciduous trees can have different-colored leaves in the fall). Finally, when you've narrowed your search to the healthiest, prettiest plants, imagine what each plant will look like after it is pruned. Part of the fun of growing a bonsai tree is gently pruning and shaping it until it's exactly how you want it - this can take years. Pick a tree whose natural shape lends itself to the pruning and\/or shaping plan you have in mind. (Many bonsai are made to look as if they were an adult tree, including proportion, shape, and foliage.)\\n\\nNote that if you choose to grow your Bonsai tree from a seed, you'll have the ability to control your tree's growth in nearly every stage of its development. However, it can take up to 5 years (depending on the species of tree) for a Bonsai tree to grow from a seed into a full-grown tree.\\nAnother option you have is to grow your Bonsai tree from a cutting. Cuttings are branches cut from growing trees and transplanted to new soil to start a separate (but genetically identical)\\n\", 'Select a pot.:  The hallmark feature of Bonsai trees is that they are planted in pots that restrict their growth. The most important factor in deciding which pot to use is to make sure the pot is large enough to allow enough soil to cover the roots of the plant. When you \\nWhile your pot must be large enough to support your tree, you\\'ll also want to maintain a neat, tidy aesthetic for your bonsai tree. Overly-large pots can dwarf the tree itself, giving a bizarre or mismatched appearance. Buy a pot big enough for the tree\\'s roots, but not much bigger - the idea is for the pot to complement the tree aesthetically, but to be relatively unobtrusive visually.\\nSome prefer to grow their Bonsai trees in plain, practical containers, then transfer them to prettier containers when they\\'re full-grown. This is an especially useful process if your species of bonsai tree is a fragile one, as it allows you to put off the purchase of the \"nice\" pot until your tree is healthy and beautiful.\\n', \"Prepare the tree.:  If you've just bought a Bonsai from the store and it came in an unappealing plastic container or you've been growing your own Bonsai tree and finally want to put it in the perfect pot, you'll need to prepare it before transplanting it. First, ensure the tree has been pruned to the shape you desire. If you'd like the tree to grow a certain way after you re-pot it, wrap a sturdy wire around the tree or branch to gently direct its growth. You want your tree in tip-top shape before you transplant it to a new pot, which can be taxing for the plant.\\n\\nKnow that trees with seasonal life cycles (for instance, many deciduous trees) are best transplanted in the spring. Rising temperatures in the spring cause many plants to enter a state of increased growth, which means they'll recover from pruning and root trimming faster.\\nYou may want to reduce watering before re-potting. Dry, loose soil can be much easier to work with than damp soil.\\n\", \"Remove the tree and clean the roots.:  Carefully remove the plant from its current pot, making sure not to break or tear its main stem. You may want to use a potting shovel to help pry the plant out. Most of the roots will be cut before the plant is re-potted into the Bonsai pot. However, to have a clear view of the roots, it's usually necessary to brush away any of the dirt stuck to them. Clean the roots, brushing away any clumps of dirt obscuring your vision. Root rakes, chopsticks, tweezers, and similar tools are helpful for this process.\\n\\nThe roots don't have to be spotless - just clean enough that you're able to see what you're doing while you prune them.\\n\", 'Prune the roots.:  If their growth is not adequately controlled, bonsai trees can easily outgrow their containers. To ensure your bonsai tree remains manageable and tidy, prune its roots when you pot it. Cut any large, thick roots and any upward-facing roots, leaving a network of long, slender roots that will sit near the surface of the soil. Water is absorbed from the root tips, so, in a small container, many thin root strands are generally better than a single large, deep one.\\n\\n', \"Prepare the pot.:  Before placing the tree in the pot, ensure it has a base of fresh, new soil to sit on that gives it the desired height. At the bottom of your empty pot, add a layer of coarse-grain soil as a base. Then, add a finer, looser growing medium or soil above this. Use a soil or medium that drains well - regular garden soil can hold too much water and may drown the roots. Leave a small amount of space at the top of your pot so that you can cover your tree's roots.\\n\\nIf your plant comes with a recommended soil texture, it will do best in that kind of soil.\\n\", \"Pot the tree.:  Position the tree in your new pot in the desired orientation. Finish adding your fine, well-draining soil or growing medium to the pot, making sure to cover the tree's root system. If desired, you may add a final layer of moss or gravel. In addition to being aesthetically pleasing, this can help hold the tree in place.\\n\\nIf your tree isn't staying upright in your new pot, run a heavy gauge wire from the bottom of the pot through the drainage holes on the bottom of the pot. Tie the wire around the root system in order to hold the plant in place.\\nYou may want to install mesh screens over the pot's drainage holes to prevent soil erosion, which occurs when water carries soil out of the pot via the drainage holes.\\n\", 'Care for your new bonsai tree.:  Your new tree has just undergone a radical, somewhat traumatic process. For 2-3 weeks after re-potting your tree, leave it in a semi-shaded area, protected from the wind or harsh, direct sunlight. Water the plant, but don\\'t use fertilizer until the roots have re-established themselves.

This is a very important thing. ","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Start a Bonsai Tree', 'description': '\\nThe ancient art of growing Bonsai trees is well over a thousand years old. Many individuals are not aware that a simple potted plant is literally the meaning of Bonsai, \"Potted Plant.\"\\nThere are however a large pool of types of plants, bushes and even trees that can be trained and kept as a Bonsai.\\nThough usually associated with Japan, Bonsai tree cultivation actually originated in China, where the trees eventually came to be associated with the religion of Zen Buddhism. Bonsai trees are now used for decorative and recreational purposes in addition to their traditional uses. Caring for bonsai trees gives the cultivator a chance to take a contemplative yet creative role in the growth of an emblem of natural beauty.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Select a suitable species of tree for your climate.:  Not all Bonsai trees are the same. Many woody perennials and even some tropical plants can be made into Bonsai trees, but not every species will be appropriate for your unique location. When selecting a species, it\\'s important to consider the climate that the tree will be grown in. For instance, some trees die in freezing weather, while others actually \\nOne particularly beginner-friendly variety of Bonsai tree is the juniper. These evergreens are hardy, surviving all across the northern hemisphere and even in the more temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. In addition, juniper trees are easy to raise - they respond well to pruning and other \"training\" efforts and, because they are evergreens, never lose their leaves. They are rather slow growing, however.\\nOther conifers commonly cultivated as Bonsai trees include pines, spruces, and cedars of many varieties. Deciduous (leafy) trees are another possibility - Japanese maples are especially beautiful, as are magnolias, elms, and oaks. Finally, some non-woody tropical plants, like jade and \"snowrose\", are good choices for indoor environments in cool or temperate climates.\\n', \"Decide whether you plan on having an indoor or outdoor tree.:  The needs of indoor and outdoor Bonsai trees can vary drastically. Generally, indoor environments are drier and receive less light than outdoor environments, so you'll want to choose trees with lower light and moisture requirements. Below are listed some of the most common varieties of bonsai tree, grouped by their appropriateness for either indoor or outdoor environments:\\n\\n\\n\\nNote that temperate species require winter dormancy or the tree will eventually die. They cannot be grown indoors for long periods of time.\\n\", \"Select the size of your bonsai.:  Bonsai trees come in a wide variety of sizes. Full-grown trees can be as small as 6 inches (15.2\\xa0cm) tall  to as large 3 feet (0.9\\xa0m) tall, depending on their species. If you're choosing to grow your Bonsai tree from a seedling or a cutting from another tree, they can start off even smaller. Larger plants require more water, soil, and sunlight, so make sure that you have all the necessary amenities before making your purchase.\\n\\nJust a few things you'll want to consider when deciding on the size of your Bonsai tree:\\nThe size of the container you'll be using\\nThe space you have available at your home or office\\nThe availability of sunlight at your home or office\\nThe amount of care you'll be able to invest in your tree (larger trees take longer to prune)\\n\", \"Visualize the finished product while selecting a plant.:   Once you have decided which kind and what size of Bonsai you would like, you can go to a nursery or a bonsai shop and select the plant that will become your bonsai tree. When choosing a plant, look for a vibrant, healthy green leaf or needle color to make sure that the plant is healthy (however, keep in mind that deciduous trees can have different-colored leaves in the fall). Finally, when you've narrowed your search to the healthiest, prettiest plants, imagine what each plant will look like after it is pruned. Part of the fun of growing a bonsai tree is gently pruning and shaping it until it's exactly how you want it - this can take years. Pick a tree whose natural shape lends itself to the pruning and\/or shaping plan you have in mind. (Many bonsai are made to look as if they were an adult tree, including proportion, shape, and foliage.)\\n\\nNote that if you choose to grow your Bonsai tree from a seed, you'll have the ability to control your tree's growth in nearly every stage of its development. However, it can take up to 5 years (depending on the species of tree) for a Bonsai tree to grow from a seed into a full-grown tree.\\nAnother option you have is to grow your Bonsai tree from a cutting. Cuttings are branches cut from growing trees and transplanted to new soil to start a separate (but genetically identical)\\n\", 'Select a pot.:  The hallmark feature of Bonsai trees is that they are planted in pots that restrict their growth. The most important factor in deciding which pot to use is to make sure the pot is large enough to allow enough soil to cover the roots of the plant. When you \\nWhile your pot must be large enough to support your tree, you\\'ll also want to maintain a neat, tidy aesthetic for your bonsai tree. Overly-large pots can dwarf the tree itself, giving a bizarre or mismatched appearance. Buy a pot big enough for the tree\\'s roots, but not much bigger - the idea is for the pot to complement the tree aesthetically, but to be relatively unobtrusive visually.\\nSome prefer to grow their Bonsai trees in plain, practical containers, then transfer them to prettier containers when they\\'re full-grown. This is an especially useful process if your species of bonsai tree is a fragile one, as it allows you to put off the purchase of the \"nice\" pot until your tree is healthy and beautiful.\\n', \"Prepare the tree.:  If you've just bought a Bonsai from the store and it came in an unappealing plastic container or you've been growing your own Bonsai tree and finally want to put it in the perfect pot, you'll need to prepare it before transplanting it. First, ensure the tree has been pruned to the shape you desire. If you'd like the tree to grow a certain way after you re-pot it, wrap a sturdy wire around the tree or branch to gently direct its growth. You want your tree in tip-top shape before you transplant it to a new pot, which can be taxing for the plant.\\n\\nKnow that trees with seasonal life cycles (for instance, many deciduous trees) are best transplanted in the spring. Rising temperatures in the spring cause many plants to enter a state of increased growth, which means they'll recover from pruning and root trimming faster.\\nYou may want to reduce watering before re-potting. Dry, loose soil can be much easier to work with than damp soil.\\n\", \"Remove the tree and clean the roots.:  Carefully remove the plant from its current pot, making sure not to break or tear its main stem. You may want to use a potting shovel to help pry the plant out. Most of the roots will be cut before the plant is re-potted into the Bonsai pot. However, to have a clear view of the roots, it's usually necessary to brush away any of the dirt stuck to them. Clean the roots, brushing away any clumps of dirt obscuring your vision. Root rakes, chopsticks, tweezers, and similar tools are helpful for this process.\\n\\nThe roots don't have to be spotless - just clean enough that you're able to see what you're doing while you prune them.\\n\", 'Prune the roots.:  If their growth is not adequately controlled, bonsai trees can easily outgrow their containers. To ensure your bonsai tree remains manageable and tidy, prune its roots when you pot it. Cut any large, thick roots and any upward-facing roots, leaving a network of long, slender roots that will sit near the surface of the soil. Water is absorbed from the root tips, so, in a small container, many thin root strands are generally better than a single large, deep one.\\n\\n', \"Prepare the pot.:  Before placing the tree in the pot, ensure it has a base of fresh, new soil to sit on that gives it the desired height. At the bottom of your empty pot, add a layer of coarse-grain soil as a base. Then, add a finer, looser growing medium or soil above this. Use a soil or medium that drains well - regular garden soil can hold too much water and may drown the roots. Leave a small amount of space at the top of your pot so that you can cover your tree's roots.\\n\\nIf your plant comes with a recommended soil texture, it will do best in that kind of soil.\\n\", \"Pot the tree.:  Position the tree in your new pot in the desired orientation. Finish adding your fine, well-draining soil or growing medium to the pot, making sure to cover the tree's root system. If desired, you may add a final layer of moss or gravel. In addition to being aesthetically pleasing, this can help hold the tree in place.\\n\\nIf your tree isn't staying upright in your new pot, run a heavy gauge wire from the bottom of the pot through the drainage holes on the bottom of the pot. Tie the wire around the root system in order to hold the plant in place.\\nYou may want to install mesh screens over the pot's drainage holes to prevent soil erosion, which occurs when water carries soil out of the pot via the drainage holes.\\n\", 'Care for your new bonsai tree.:  Your new tree has just undergone a radical, somewhat traumatic process. For 2-3 weeks after re-potting your tree, leave it in a semi-shaded area, protected from the wind or harsh, direct sunlight. Water the plant, but don\\'t use fertilizer until the roots have re-established themselves. By giving your tree a \"breather\" after re-potting, you allow it to adapt to its new home, and, in time, thrive.\\n\\nAs noted above, deciduous trees with yearly life cycles experience a period of intensified growth in the spring. Because of this, it\\'s best to re-pot deciduous trees in the spring after their winter dormancy has ended.

Use a complete fertilizer high in nitrogen (N) and potassium (K), such as a 15-5-15 or 5-2-5.\\nReduce fertilizer as the final fruits ripen. Do not fertilize in late autumn or winter, unless using artificial grow lights and reliable heaters.\\n', 'Remove suckers weekly.:  Once a week, pinch off \"suckers,\" or side shoots that emerge where a leaf meets the main stem. Leave only the main bud at the top of the steam, plus the highest sucker below it. This trains the plant to grow upward instead of wide.\\nIf the top of your plant is damaged, the top sucker can become the new main stem.\\n', \"Stake the tomato plants: .\\nIn peak growing season, the plant will grow up to 6 in (15 cm) per week and will need tying each week.\\nCommercial operations save on materials by stringing a wire over each row, with a support post every 20 ft (6m). Wrap the twine around each plant and fasten to the overhead wire.\\nFor smaller home gardens, you can place a tomato cage over each plant when it is small. These don't require as much maintenance as staking.\\n\", \"Pollinate the flowers.:  Unlike many plants, a tomato can pollinate itself \u2014 but it needs some help. The pollen in a tomato flower is trapped inside a tube, and must be released through vibration. Since most greenhouses lack bees or high wind, you'll need to act as the pollinator once flowers are fully open:\\nFor best results, buy an electric plant vibrator. Touch the vibrator against each flower stalk every other day, at any time between 10am and 2pm. (An electric toothbrush is another, less effective option.)\\nAlternatively, you can place fans in the greenhouse and direct the airflow over your plants to distribute the pollen.\\nLarge operations should consider keeping their own bees.\\nHand out cotton swabs to your children or family members and have them rub the cotton swabs in the flowers to distribute pollen.\\n\", 'Prune leaves and fruit.:  Apart from weekly sucker removal, pruning is not necessary until the plant starts to fruit:\\nOnce fruit starts to grow, thin each cluster down to four or five fruits, removing the smallest or most misshapen. Very large fruits or winter conditions may require going down to three per cluster. Varieties with small fruits may not need any thinning.\\nAs the fruit matures, snap off older leaves from the lower clusters. This helps improve air circulation.\\n', 'Harvest as late as possible.:  The longer the tomatoes stay on the vine, the fuller and redder they become.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"fertilize regularly","question_type":"['complex']","text_question":"Yummy Yummy Maters!!

Here's what you need to know to shape and smooth fresh concrete into an attractive, long-lasting surface. Try to move quickly except where noted otherwise so you can finish before the concrete dries, especially on a hot day.\\n\\n\", 'steps': ['Pour the concrete: .\\n', 'Compress the concrete only if necessary.:  Many modern concrete mixes do not need to be compressed, or \"tamped\", before finishing, and tamping the wrong mix can weaken the slab.\\nIf you do decide to tamp, simply press the concrete down using any variety of tamping tool (hand, rolling, etc.).\\n', 'Place a 2x4 across the concrete.:  Find the straightest lumber 2x4 you can find and place it across the barriers holding the concrete in place, or \"forms\". The 2x4 should extend at least a foot past the forms in each direction. This object is referred to as a \\n', \"Use the 2x4 to level the concrete.:  Using the technique described below, move the 2x4 down the forms to remove excess concrete.\\nUse a sawing motion to pull and push the 2x4 across the concrete as you move it down the length of the forms. This sawing motion helps prevent tearing as you level the surface.\\nTilt the leading edge slightly away from the direction of travel to create a thin cutting edge where the screed board meets the concrete.\\nKeep at least a 1 inch (2.5cm) hump of concrete in front of the edge at all times. This will fill any holes in the concrete's surface.\\nPour and level in stages for larger projects.\\nAt the end of the slab, push the excess concrete against the forms for easy removal with later tools.\\n\", 'Immediately level and prepare further using a bull float.:  The bull float is a flat, long-handled tool used to flatten minor ridges and holes, as well as embed aggregate particles further into the concrete, bringing the smoother \"cream\" consistency concrete to the surface for better finishing.\\nThe bull float should have rounded ends, not flat or straight ends. Avoid using a square float, as it will make smoothing out the concrete more difficult.\\nMove the bull float back and forth across the slab, perpendicular to the direction you moved the leveling board. (In other words, move the bull float between the two forms the 2x4 was resting on.)\\nSlightly lift the leading edge to create a smaller cutting edge of contact, lifting the tool toward you when pushing and away from you while pulling. Some bull floats will have a handle that will lift the tool for you when you turn it. Don\\'t overdo it; the edge of the tool should remain level with the concrete.\\nTry to finish this process before any \"bleed water\" leaks out onto the concrete\\'s surface.\\n', \"Use an alternative tool (optional).:  A magnesium float is a short-handled tool that serves the same purpose as a bull float for smaller projects.\\nMove the magnesium float back and forth in overlapping arcs until the whole surface has been covered twice.\\nA power float requires two people to place it carefully onto the slab, but only one to operate it. It takes a little practice to work properly, so stay near the center of the slab while you're learning to avoid damaging the concrete's edge.\\n\", \"Tidy the corners using a smaller tool.:  An edging tool is designed to create level edges and corners next to the form, where your larger bull float or magnesium float is less accurate. This will create more durable edges as well as improve the concrete's appearance.\\nUse a back-and-forth motion in a 1- to 2-ft. (0.3\u20130.6m) area before moving on to the next. As with previous tools, lift the leading edge of the tool.\\nDon't press too deeply into the concrete; this can create impressions that are difficult to remove.\\n\", 'Cut grooves into your concrete.:  These are called \\nThe distance between joints should be no more than 24 times the thickness of the slab.\\nEvery inside corner of your slab and every corner that touches a building or step should have a control joint extending from it, as these are common cracking locations.\\nUse a straightedge or snap line to lightly mark the joints before cutting and keep your tool straight as you cut.\\nA grooving tool works well for most projects. If your concrete has already started to dry and crack, use a dry-cut saw that can cut to the desired depth. For extra large projects, use a long-handled marking tool.\\n', 'Wait for the concrete to partially dry.:  It takes experience to learn the correct timing for concrete, since its drying speed depends on many factors such as the characteristics of the mix and the local temperature and humidity. Here are the basic details:\\n\\nAs the concrete sets, excess \"bleed water\" will rise to the surface.\\nIf the concrete is still quite wet and forms ridges when you move on to the next step, wait longer.\\nIf the concrete becomes too hard and dry to finish properly, throw additional water onto its surface. This is a last resort as it will result in weakness and scaling in the final slab.\\n', 'Apply a color hardener (optional).:  If you are coloring your concrete using a powder that adds color to the top layer, apply this in the amount specified on the label while the concrete still has a full wet shine. It will still require a little more drying before you proceed to the next stage.\\n\\nOnly use on horizontal surfaces and with proper safety equipment to avoid inhalation.\\n', 'Smooth and compact the surface once again with a hand float.:  This is the final smoothing, bringing the more consistent \"cream\" of the concrete to the surface for a level, durable finish.\\nMagnesium floats are very popular among professionals, since they are lightweight and excellent at opening up the concrete\\'s pores for evaporation.\\nAluminum floats are very similar to magnesium, but somewhat heavier and stronger (and so a little more difficult to handle).\\nWooden floats (redwood or hardwood) are cheap but wear out quickly. They create a rough fuzzy surface useful for very stiff concrete or if using colored hardeners (which need to be mixed in with the rougher tool).\\nLaminated-canvas resin floats are used for the same purposes as wood but are a much more durable (and expensive) tool.\\nAs before, lift the leading edge slightly and make shallow flat motions across the surface.\\n', 'Consider a trowel finish.:  Many people skip troweling if they plan to broom, as it only results in minor improvement in that scenario. Troweling without brooming results in a very slick surface (unsafe for surfaces that will get wet) and may cause fine cracks to develop called \"crazing\".\\n\\nUse a magnesium trowel in much the same way you used previous finishing tools. You can create a very smooth finish by passing over the slab two or three times, waiting for the concrete to dry slightly between passes and lifting the leading edge a little more each time.\\nSteel trowels can also be used, but inexpert timing could cause the steel to trap water inside the concrete and damage it.\\nTroweling too deep or troweling \"air-entrained\" concrete mixes can release the concrete\\'s air bubbles and prevent it from setting correctly.\\nLarger troweling tools (or other long-handled finishing tools) are sometimes referred to as \"fresnos\".\\n', 'Try a broom finish.:  Most people end with a broom finish to create a non-slip surface. You can do this with or without a preceding trowel finish.\\n\\nUse a medium stiff or stiffer shop broom (the wide rectangular kind). The bristles should be stiff enough to leave noticeable marks, and the concrete should be soft enough to be shaped by them but hard enough to retain them (not sinking back together).\\nDip the broom into a bucket of water, then shake off the excess (not onto the concrete).\\nDrag the broom gently over the concrete in segments. Overlap the previous segment to ensure full coverage.\\nIf the surface is intended to drain, create the grooves in the direction liquids are supposed to flow.\\n', \"Cure the concrete: .\\nThe simplest method is to wet the concrete's surface and cover it with plastic sheeting. Weigh down the sheet's edges with heavy objects.\\nThere are many other ways to keep the concrete wet, but these tend to require more water or maintenance than plastic.\\nConcrete curing chemicals are often used for professional jobs. These come in many varieties, so consult someone familiar with your concrete mix for advice on selecting one.\\nBegin curing as soon as possible. Once begun, keep off foot traffic for 24 hours, light vehicles such as bicycles for 1 week, and car traffic for 2 weeks. Complete curing takes at least 30 days, and longer at the corners and edges.\\n\", 'Seal the concrete: .\\nClean the slab well before applying sealant.\\nApply thinly to avoid puddles. If needed, wait a couple hours (or as the label instructs you), then apply a second layer perpendicular to the first.\\nAllow sealant to dry completely before walking over or placing anything onto the concrete. Wait three days before allowing vehicle traffic.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Tamp (only if appropriate)', '2x4 for leveling', 'Bull float or darby', 'Hand float', 'Edging tool', 'Straightedge or snap line', 'Grooving tool, dry-cut saw, or marking tool', 'Hand float (see advice above on types)', 'Color hardener (optional)', 'Magnesium trowel (optional)', 'Broom (optional for some projects)']}","extracted_answer":"wait three days before allowing vehicle traffic","question_type":"['navigation']","text_question":"I have sealed the driveway after waiting one month, is there anything else that I should do?","question_id":"diy-21-6","intent_question":"request_next_step","intent_answer":"answer_question_external_fact"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-29","question":"Ok.

If you don't want to start indoors, buy plants to use outdoors.\\n\", 'Plant them 4 to 5 to a cell.:  If you have a seed starter with individual cells, you can start out by adding 4 to 5 seeds to a cell. They should be about 1\/2 inch deep. A cell is just the individual cup of soil that you plant seeds in.\\nIf you have a flat planter inside, plant them 1\/4 inch apart.\\nYou still want to plant them 1\/2 an inch deep, though.\\n', \"Trim as needed.:  While they are growing, your plants may get too tall. When they do, they'll start drooping. If that's the case, it's fine to trim them back to 3 inches.\\n\", \"Find a good location.:  Onions should be planted in a sunny location. That means that the area doesn't get any shade from other plants, including trees or your house.\\nThe best way to figure out which location is sunniest in your yard is to monitor it.\\nSpend a day going outside every couple of hours. Notice which areas are sunniest throughout the day.\\nWhen choosing the location, pick the one that has the most sun for onions.\\n\", \"Try raised beds.: Start by measuring out your bed. Four feet by four feet is fairly standard, as most people can reach to the middle of the bed. Make the ground even with a shovel or rake.\\nGet the wood you'll need. You'll need 4X4s as stakes for the corners. They should be a foot each. You'll also need 2X2s for the center stakes, four of them. Finally, you'll 2X6s for the sides. They need to be 4 feet long, and you'll need 8 of them.\\nLay out your 2X6s on the square. Start by screwing one 2X6 into the side of the 4X4 post, flush with the bottom and the outer edge. Place another 2X6 on top of the other one in the same position but further up the post. It should be flush with the top and right up against the first one. Screw it in.\\nThe next set of 2X6s should be added so that they go to the edge of the post but cover up the ends of the other boards. In other words, the first boards should run into the second, with the post sticking on the outside rather than the inside. Continue around the square until all the boards are joined. Once you've done that, measure across the square diagonally to make sure it's all square. If it's not, adjust the square by moving it slightly.\\nAdd the other stakes. Hammer them into the ground up against the middle of each wall on the outside, then use deck screws to attach them to the wall. Finally, add in soil.\\n\", \"Create raised rows.:  Another option is raised rows. Raised rows are like raised beds, but they aren't structured like raised beds. Instead, you create them with just the soil.\\n\\nWhen the soil is dry, spread biodegradable material on top of it, such as compost or rotting hay or grass. With a garden rake or rototiller, work it into the soil until the soil is loose and crumbly.\\nStake out how you want your rows to go. You want them to be about 4 feet wide or a little shorter if you can't reach to the middle. Between the rows, you need space to walk. If you want room for a wheelbarrow, make the in-between part at least a foot to two feet wide.\\nCreate raised beds by moving the soil from the paths into the raised beds. A rake is good for this purpose. You may need to use a shovel near the end. To keep the paths from growing anything, line them with newspaper (5 pieces thick). You can also use cardboard. Put mulch or wood chips on top.\\n\", \"Check your soil.:  You can find soil kits at your local gardening store, or you can take a soil sample into your county extension office for testing. Your soil should be at between 6 and 6.8 pH.\\nYou may need to adjust the pH of the soil.\\nIf you need to make it more acidic (down towards 6.8), you'll add powdered sulfur, aluminum sulfate, or iron sulfate.\\nTo up the pH (make it slightly more alkaline), add lime.\\nIf you need help deciding how much, use a pH kit from your local university agriculture extension office, which will give you detailed instructions about what to add. Find your local extension at\\n\", 'Add nitrogen.:  Onions need nitrogen to grow well. Therefore, always add nitrogen to the soil before planting. You can also work nitrogen in the soil in the fall to help for the next spring.\\nThe easiest way to add nitrogen is to use a fertilizer rich in nitrogen. Good sources of nitrogen include fertilizers, composted manure, blood meal, and other composted organic materials.\\n', \"Harden off the plants.:  You should harden off the plants when it starts warming up outside, and you are getting ready to move them outside. Hardening off the plants just means you start getting the plants accustomed to being outside by giving them short visits. Start by putting them outside for a couple hours on a temperate day. It should at least be in the 40s. \\n\\nIncrease the amount of time they spend outside each day by a couple of hours.\\nAlso, start lessening how much you water them. As they move outside, they'll get less water. You have to get them accustomed to them. Give them just enough water to keep them from wilting.\\n\", \"Plant in the ground.:  Once you've spent a week to a week and a half hardening the plants, it's time to plant them. You can plant outside once the temperature reaches about 50 degrees Fahrenheit.\\nLate March to early April is usually a good time.\\nOf course, if you have late winters, you may need to wait longer.\\nYou can plant 2 to 4 weeks before the last frost date.\\n\", 'Space out the onions.:  If you want especially large bulbs, put them 4 to 6 inches apart.\\nThe rows should be 12 inches a part.\\nWhether you did rows or beds, that means you should be able to get 2 furrows (rows) per row or bed.\\n', 'Trim the plants.:  The plants should be about 4 inches once they are in the ground. Use shears to trim down the plants once you get them all planted.\\n', \"Water regularly.:  Onions need a lot of water. In fact, they need about an inch a week. If you aren't getting rain, you will need to water the onions regularly.\\nIf you're not sure when to water them, check the soil to see if it's moist. While the plants are leafing, it needs to always be moist. However, once a week should be sufficient as long as they get a good soaking.\\nOnce the bulbs start getting larger (when the plant part stops growing), the bulbs  need to be kept much drier.\\n\", \"Mulch as needed.:  You can add a layer of mulch around the plants. The mulch will suppress weeds coming up.\\nOrganic materials also improve the soil over time.\\nMulch helps the soil retain water, as well.\\nHowever, you'll need to remove the mulch once the bulbs start to enlarge. You should see them start pushing up the soil a bit. The bulbs need to be drier, and mulch retains too much moisture.\\n\", \"Wait to harvest.:  For large, dry bulb onions, you'll need to wait at least 100 days but up to 175 days to harvest. If you're fine with green onions, you can harvest them in as little as 3 weeks to a month.\\n\"], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"wait at least 100 days but up to 175 days to harvest","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"How long should I expect the onions to grow before they are ready for harvest?","question_id":"diy-38-7","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-56","question":"Will this require re-grading my landscaping?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Prevent-Mold-from-Growing-in-Your-Home","data_split":"validation","original_answer":"Depending on how the area outside your house runs, you may need to regrade your lawn.

Pumpkins fall into the same category, but some are good eating while others are fibrous and\/or watery. Like so many vegetables and fruits on the market, the commercial varieties are often chosen for criteria other than flavor, but there's a huge variety of types that you can grow yourself.\\n\\n\", 'steps': [\"Choose varieties based on your climate and the space you have available.:  If you have a long warm season you can grow almost anything; if it's shorter make sure to pick early-ripening types. Some squash grow on vines that can cover a lot of ground, so if you just have a 12 x 12 foot space, you're better off with a bush variety. Most details will be found on the packaging. Here are a few basics to consider:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'Aim to plant your seeds after the last frost.:  You should plant your squash seeds at the beginning of spring when the soil has warmed to at least 60\u00b0F (15\u00b0C). Alternatively, you can plant them indoors under bright, fluorescent lights.\\n\\nIn zone 6 and warmer, you can even plant your seeds in early summer. You should stop planting about 14 weeks before the first expected \"frost.\"\\nIf you are planting them inside, use biodegradable pots, such as peat pots, so that you can plant the entire pot when you transplant them outside. Removing squash from a plastic pot can disturb their roots and stunt their growth.\\n', 'Prepare your soil.:  Squash like warm conditions with soil that is fertile, well-drained, and has a pH of 6 to 6.5 To get good growth and production, you\\'ll need to add lots of organic matter to your garden. Rotted manure and compost are the best for getting your plants the nutrients they need. Dig them in deeply so that the squash\\'s roots will penetrate easily.\\n\\nSquash are often planted in \"hills.\" These help the squash grow by warming the soil more quickly and increasing drainage. Even in well-drained areas, hills can give your plants a boost by providing warm soil as they begin growing.\\nHills don\\'t always literally mean a raised area. If you have fast-draining soil and a drier climate, you might actually make depressions, with a wide ridge around them, to hold water. Add some extra compost\/manure to the area under your hills, too.\\n', 'Plant six seeds per hill about an inch (2 cm) deep in a sunny spot.:   You want each hill to be part of a 3-ft wide row (they need their space). Leave about 5 to 6 feet (2 meters) between hills. Loosen the soil for up to a foot below the surface to ensure adequate drainage \u2013 you can mix in manure or compost at this step, too.\\n\\nThey should appear in about 10 days. If you have a short season, you can get a jump on your growing time by planting them indoors, but if you plant too early and the squash become rootbound in their pots, it will actually stunt their growth.\\nUpon planting, water them well. They need the initial burst of water to get going.\\n', \"Give your plants about 1 inch (2.: 5 cm) of water a week\\nRemove the weeds so they don't steal your water; a lack of water can stunt your plants, and weeds will use the nutrients you took all that trouble to dig into your soil.\\nA drip system is nice but if you don't want to do that, simple trenches between the hills will help you get the water where you want it once the vines start getting rampant.\\nWatering in the early morning allows the water to evaporate; this is good because water standing on leaves can create good conditions for disease.\\nOn hot days, it is normal for leaves to wilt a little bit during the heat of the day, but they will often firm back up in the evening.\\n\", 'Thin your plants.:  Once your plants have put on a few leaves (this is called \"germinating\"), cull all but two or three at the very most per hill, leaving only the most vigorous plants. There simply isn\\'t enough room for all of them to grow to adulthood.\\n\\nAt this stage, you may want to set up row covers to protect your little plants from insects and make sure they grow to full capacity.\\n', 'Watch out for bugs and disease.:  In the US, squash bugs and squash vine borers can do in a vine in no time. Dark gray squash bugs lurk under the leaves and suck the plant\\'s juices. Borers are a caterpillar or a small moth that bores into the stems, killing the stem beyond the damage. Watch for their eggs under the leaves and along the ground. If you live in Europe you don\\'t have those insects but other things can still damage your plants, so be vigilant!\\n\\nFloating row covers can help with this problem, though you\\'ll have to remove them when your female flowers show up so they can be pollinated. Aphids can be controlled with soap spray or water and as a last result, use neem.\\n\"Powdery mildew\" is another culprit, though non-bug, that you need to look out for. In the second half of their growing, spray the plants with a mixture of one part milk to six parts water every two weeks to fend off this disease\\n', \"Consider adding more fertilizer.:   In about a month, you can add a side dressing of fertilizer to the vines \u2013 about 10 inches on either side. Don't dig too close or you'll damage the roots they send down at each leaf node.\\n\\nThey won't be fully ripe for about 80 to 110 days, depending on the variety you've planted.\\n\", \"Look for flowers.:  By this point, you should start seeing flowers.

Rotted manure and compost are the best for getting your plants the nutrients they need.

Even in well-drained areas, hills can give your plants a boost by providing warm soil as they begin growing.\\nHills don\\'t always literally mean a raised area. If you have fast-draining soil and a drier climate, you might actually make depressions, with a wide ridge around them, to hold water. Add some extra compost\/manure to the area under your hills, too.\\n', 'Plant six seeds per hill about an inch (2 cm) deep in a sunny spot.:   You want each hill to be part of a 3-ft wide row (they need their space).

Removing squash from a plastic pot can disturb their roots and stunt their growth.\\n', 'Prepare your soil.:  Squash like warm conditions with soil that is fertile, well-drained, and has a pH of 6 to 6.5 To get good growth and production, you\\'ll need to add lots of organic matter to your garden. Rotted manure and compost are the best for getting your plants the nutrients they need. Dig them in deeply so that the squash\\'s roots will penetrate easily.\\n\\nSquash are often planted in \"hills.\" These help the squash grow by warming the soil more quickly and increasing drainage. Even in well-drained areas, hills can give your plants a boost by providing warm soil as they begin growing.\\nHills don\\'t always literally mean a raised area. If you have fast-draining soil and a drier climate, you might actually make depressions, with a wide ridge around them, to hold water.

Rhubarb should be planted in a sunny area and given plenty of nutrients to grow healthy and strong. Read on to learn how to plant, care for and harvest rhubarb.\\n\\n', 'steps': [\"Determine whether you're in the right growing zone.:  Rhubarb is a cool-season plant that requires temperatures that drop below 40\\xa0\u00b0F (4\\xa0\u00b0C) in order to stimulate growth.\\nRhubarb grows best in USDA hardiness zones 3-8. This includes much of the northern parts of the Midwest as well as the northeastern regions of the US.\\nRhubarb wilts during the heat of hot southern summers. If you live in a southern region where it regularly goes above 75\\xa0\u00b0F (24\\xa0\u00b0C), it will probably be difficult to grow this plant.\\n\", \"Get rhubarb crowns to plant in the spring.:  Rhubarb is best grown from roots (crowns), not seed, since the seeds take a long time to get established and there's no guarantee they'll ever germinate. Go to your local nursery and buy rhubarb roots or purchase some from an online source.\\n\\nIf you have a friend with a rhubarb plant, you may be able to dig up a crown from the side of their plant to get yours started.\\n\", \"Choose a planting site.:  Rhubarb should be planted in an area in full sun. Look for a spot that drains well, since rhubarb won't do as well if water sits around its base. To determine whether soil drains well, dig a hole and fill it with water. If the water sits in the hole, the soil there doesn't drain well. If it immediately soaks into the ground, the soil is great for planting rhubarb.\\nYou may want to stick a ruler in the hole so that you can measure how quickly it drains. Ideally the water should drain out at a rate of 1-3 inches per hour. If it drains too fast, your plant will dry out; too slow and the roots may rot.\\n\", \"Prepare the soil for planting.:  Clear out weeds and other plants that may interfere with the rhubarb plants. Till your gardening bed to a depth of several feet and mix in plenty of compost, rotted manure or other organic matter to enrich the soil.

Ideally the location should have good drainage. You can test this by digging a small hole and filling it with water. If the water doesn't drain quickly then the soil doesn't have sufficient drainage.

Its tart, fresh flavor is sought after by cooks looking for something special to make into pie and other desserts. Rhubarb should be planted in a sunny area and given plenty of nutrients to grow healthy and strong. Read on to learn how to plant, care for and harvest rhubarb.\\n\\n', 'steps': [\"Determine whether you're in the right growing zone.:  Rhubarb is a cool-season plant that requires temperatures that drop below 40\\xa0\u00b0F (4\\xa0\u00b0C) in order to stimulate growth.\\nRhubarb grows best in USDA hardiness zones 3-8. This includes much of the northern parts of the Midwest as well as the northeastern regions of the US.\\nRhubarb wilts during the heat of hot southern summers. If you live in a southern region where it regularly goes above 75\\xa0\u00b0F (24\\xa0\u00b0C), it will probably be difficult to grow this plant.\\n\", \"Get rhubarb crowns to plant in the spring.:  Rhubarb is best grown from roots (crowns), not seed, since the seeds take a long time to get established and there's no guarantee they'll ever germinate. Go to your local nursery and buy rhubarb roots or purchase some from an online source.\\n\\nIf you have a friend with a rhubarb plant, you may be able to dig up a crown from the side of their plant to get yours started.\\n\", \"Choose a planting site.:  Rhubarb should be planted in an area in full sun. Look for a spot that drains well, since rhubarb won't do as well if water sits around its base. To determine whether soil drains well, dig a hole and fill it with water. If the water sits in the hole, the soil there doesn't drain well. If it immediately soaks into the ground, the soil is great for planting rhubarb.\\nYou may want to stick a ruler in the hole so that you can measure how quickly it drains. Ideally the water should drain out at a rate of 1-3 inches per hour. If it drains too fast, your plant will dry out; too slow and the roots may rot.\\n\", \"Prepare the soil for planting.:  Clear out weeds and other plants that may interfere with the rhubarb plants.

If the weather is dry, give a new plant a thorough watering every week until it is well established.\\n\", 'Use deep watering.:  Camellias love deep watering about twice weekly, rather than daily shallow watering. This is partially because camellias love generally moist soil as opposed to soggy soil. Giving a deep soak allows the soil to have a generally moist consistency for longer.\\n\\n', \"Mulch around your camellia.:  Mulching will help keep moisture in the ground and it will keep the soil cooler on hot summer days. In addition, mulch will help keep weeds at bay.\\nUse whatever mulch you have readily available but don't pile it more than a few inches high, no matter what you use. This can keep soil too wet and lead to root rot.\\nRemember that the mulch should not touch the trunk of the plant.\\nMulch also adds new organic material to your soil. This will help to break up clay soil or add richness to sandy soil. In general, it will increase the quality of your top soil tremendously.\\n\", 'Apply a suitable fertilizer every spring.:  Some Camellias are considered heavy eaters, meaning that they need a lot of nutrients from the soil in order to thrive. This will ensure lush growth and good flowering each season.\\n\\nThere are other varieties too, where the plant is not a heavy feeder, and do not react well to over-stimulation.\\nDo not fertilize after August. Interestingly, their bloom time is also their dormant period and so should not be fertilized then.\\nCottonseed meal and fish emulsion are good natural choices. Two or three feedings between April 1 and September 1 is all that is necessary.\\nContact your local extension service or camellia experts to get recommendations of fertilizers that work well in your specific area and for your specific variety of the plant.\\nFertilizers usually have three numbers on them, which tells you about the nutrients in it. The first number is for nitrogen, the second number is for phosphorus, and the third number is for potassium.\\nIf you want your camellia to increase in size because it is newly planted, give it a fertilizer with a larger first number, such as 10 or 12.\\nIf you just want to maintain the size of an already established plant, then a lower first number, such as 4, will work well.\\n', \"Don't overdo the acid.:  There is a common perception that camellias are acid-loving. The reality is that camellias prefer slightly acidic conditions but they do not like very acidic conditions. If you've been overdoing the acidic fertilizing, stop now!\\n\\nIf you\\nIf you notice the leaves turning yellow, the camellia likely needs more acid in the soil. Re-pot with fresh potting soil formulated for acid-loving plants.\\n\", 'Look for infestations.: \\n\\nCheck the top and the underside of the leaves weekly for aphids and spider mites. When you spot an infestation, rinse off the insects with a strong stream of water.\\nCheck the woody stems for scale insects. Scale appears as raised welts that scrape off easily. Spray scale with a ready-mixed all-season horticultural oil.\\n', 'Prune right after blooming.:  If you prune right after blooming then you will give the plant time to rejuvenate and grow new buds for the following spring. There is a good period of dormant time between when the plant blooms and when it starts to sprout new growth for you to do this.\\nPruning at other times of year will not kill a well-established plant. However, it will eliminate your buds for the following spring, so prune off season carefully.\\n', 'Remove dead and dying growth.: To avoid the chance of disease entering the plant, cut branches flush to feeder branches, instead of leaving nubs.\\n', \"Shape bushes to your liking.:  To begin with, remove leggy or lanky branches that stick out and don't look good. Then \\nSevere pruning means removing one third to one half of the plant. This should be done without fear of losing the plant, as most camellias are very strong and will outlive those that planted them. However, the year following a severe pruning you will probably have fewer blooms, as the plant is focused on regrowing its branches and leaves.\\nLight pruning can be done with small hand shears or larger shaping shears. You will get a cleaner look if you prune individual branches, as opposed to cutting large swaths with shaping shears.\\n\"], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"if you prune right after blooming then you will give the plant time to rejuvenate and grow new buds for the following spring","question_type":"['confirmation']","text_question":"If I prune the camellias right after they bloom will that hurt the flowers at all?","question_id":"diy-80-10","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-85","question":"When I'm watering the seeding, how much water should I use each time?

Once you have established the rise and run of your stairs and have drawn them out on your wood, you simply need to cut along your lines with precision and care.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Measure out:  how much total rise your stairs need.\\nThis distance should be from the top of the finished floor below and the finished floor at the top. If the floor is unfinished when you are calculating your stringers, you need to take that into account.\\n', 'Determine how tall you want each step to be.:  The height of each step can vary a bit but there are general standards. It is standard to have your riser be about 7 inches (18\\xa0cm) tall, so use this measurement unless you have specific parameters that prevent it, such as limited headroom. \\nThis measurement is sometimes called the individual rise of the stairs.\\n', 'Divide:  the overall rise by the individual rise to get the number of stairs.\\nFor example, if you want 7 inches (18\\xa0cm) tall stairs and your overall rise needs to be 56 inches (140\\xa0cm), then 56\/7=8.

Epiphyllum cacti are also vulnerable against hail, which may not be big enough to break the stems but can cause unsightly scars where each hailstone has struck.\\nThe most optimal time to plant cacti is during the period from April to September.  This will ensure a warm, sunny atmosphere while also avoiding direct sunlight that may hinder growth.\\n', \"Repot the plants after 1 to 2 years.:   Changing the potting mix will resupply the nutrients that will have naturally been absorbed by your cactus\\n\\nEach plant's size will determine when you need to repot it. A plant that is growing well and is beginning to get too big for the pot will need to be moved to a bigger pot, while a plant that remains small can stay in the same pot for longer.\\nUse 7 to 8 inch (17.5 to 20 cm) plastic pots with the same drainage holes and potting mix.\\nWrap newspaper around the stem of each plant to prevent damage.\\nHolding the plant around the base of the stem, turn it upside down, and carefully tap the pot against a hard surface such as the underside of a table to loosen the soil from the inside of the pot.  Gently pull the pot away from the plant and remove the old soil.\\nExamine the roots. If any show signs of rot or any other damage cut them away as close to the plant as possible.\\nDon't be discouraged if you haven't noticed any flowers; an epiphyllum cactus will not bloom until it has grown to the size of its pot, which usually occurs 3 to 4 years after planting the cutting.\\n\", 'Disinfect your pruning shears with a bleach-water solution.:   This will prevent your cactus from sustaining diseases or other infections that can affect growth.\\n\\nUse a 10% diluted bleach solution, mixing 1 part chlorine bleach with 1 part water.\\n', 'Clip off flowers after the blossoms expire.:   Make your cut just below the flower head.\\n\\nPruning dead parts of the plant not only improves its appearance, but it will also encourage new growth and healthy blossoming.\\n', 'Cut all dead, diseased, and broken stems back to the point of origin on the main stem.:   When you locate a stem to remove, follow it back to the base of the stem and make a straight cut just outside the joint of the parent stem.\\n\\nImmediately disinfect shears after trimming dead or diseased stems.  This will keep the disease from spreading throughout the plant.\\nIt is best to assume that any dead stem died as a result of a disease.  Disinfecting after each pruning session may require more bleach, but it will keep your cactus healthy and beautiful.\\n', 'Remove any long stems that disrupt the balance of the epiphyllum.:   Trace them back to the parent stem and cut at the base.\\n\\nThese stems are usually located along the outer edges.  Remove stems as needed until all sides of the plant are fairly uniform.\\n', \"Inspect your cactus for mealybugs, scale insects, and spider mites.:   Snails are fairly simple to spot and remove (use store-bought snail bait), but the aforementioned bugs require specific measures for preventing infestation.\\n\\nMealybugs have a waxy, white, cottony appearance.  They are slow-moving and usually are in clusters along leaf veins or spines, on the underside of leaves, and in hidden areas at the joints.\\nScale insects resemble small, cottony dome-shaped shells.  They attach themselves to stems and leaves but can be pried off.\\nSpider-mites are hard to see with the naked eye, but signs of infestation include webbing and small brown dots, especially on younger growth.  If you tap the affected area of the plant over a piece of white paper, spider-mites will resemble dust.\\nThese insects tend to suck the plant's juices resulting in weak, wrinkled, or shriveled leaves.  Severe infestations can result in the death of the plant.  The first symptoms can include stickiness or black mold on or near the plant.\\n\", 'Remove mealybugs and scale insects with cotton swabs dipped in alcohol.:   You can also spray with a diluted alcohol solution of 1 parts alcohol and 3 parts water.\\n\\nSpraying is best for fighting spider-mite infestation and other hard-to-spot bugs.  Be cautious, however, as this may damage the epidermis of the cactus.  Test a small area before spraying the entire plant.\\n', 'Use insecticidal soap to coat the plant.:   Insecticidal soap can be purchased at your local garden or home improvement store.\\n\\nThis treatment may also damage your cactus.  Since cacti have oils and waxes that make them susceptible to damage, it is best to use it sparingly and to test a small area before washing the entire cactus.\\n', \"Spray with insecticides to kill bugs and stop serious infestation.:   Use insecticides like Neem or pyrethrins for visible bugs.  Systemic insecticides such as imidacloprid or Acephate are best for controlling pests that aren't as easily accessible.\\n\\nConsult the label to see how much you should use on your cactus and whether or not prolonged use is safe.\\n\", \"Quarantine new plants from infested plants.:   Remember that infestation isn't just harmful, it is contagious and will spread from plant to plant until it is stopped.\\n\\nCheck new plants carefully for the previously mentioned symptoms and bugs.  If you are sure it is pest free, keep it in an area far away from the infected plants.  If you do find pests on your new plants, it may be best to simply discard it rather than treat it to save you time, money, and effort.\\n\"], 'ingredients': ['Epiphyllum cuttings', '4 inch (10 cm) plastic pots', 'Potting mix for epiphyllum cacti', 'Perlite', 'Orchid bark', 'Hanging containers', 'Water', '7 to 8 inch (17.5 to 20 cm) plastic pots', 'Newspaper', 'Low or no-nitrogen fertilizer', '10-10-10 or 5-5-5 fertilizer']}","extracted_answer":"your epiphyllum cactus will do best indoors","question_type":"['confirmation']","text_question":"Will the cactus be safe for humans or pets indoors, such as inhaling spores?","question_id":"diy-125-7","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_external_fact"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-128","question":"Doesn't the chewing gum stick to the bag?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Remove-Chewing-Gum-from-Jeans","data_split":"validation","original_answer":"Good question.

You can propagate the seeds directly in soil, or in a plastic resealable bag with a damp paper towel. This article will show you how to plant lemon seeds using both methods. It will also give you tips on how to choose the best lemon seed, and how to take care of your seedling.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Prepare your potting soil in a separate bucket.:  Pour some soil into a large bucket and add water to it until it is damp. Mix the soil with your hand or a trowel until it is evenly damp. Do not allow the soil to become soggy, or the seeds will rot. You will need a well-draining soil. Lemon trees love water, but they hate to sit in it.\\n\\nTry to get a pasteurized soil mix. Pasteurization gets rid of any bacteria that can kill seeds.\\nConsider getting a soil that is a blend of peat, perlite, vermiculite, and organic fertilizer. This will give your seedling proper drainage and nutrients.\\n', 'Choose a small pot with drainage holes.:  The pot should be about 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) wide, and 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 centimeters) deep.\\nYour pot must have drainage holes. If your pot does not have any, you will need to drill some.\\n', 'Fill the pot with soil.:  Stop when the top of the soil is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) from the rim.\\n', 'Make a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeter) deep hole in the soil.:  You can do this using your finger or a pencil.\\n\\n', \"Choose a plump-looking seed from a lemon.:  It may be necessary to use an organic lemon because seeds from a non-organic lemon may not sprout. Also, avoid taking any seeds that look too tiny (like a grain of rice) or that look shriveled (like a raisin). These seeds either won't sprout or won't grow into healthy seedlings.\\n\\nConsider planting 5 to 10 lemon seeds at one time, in case some of the seeds don't sprout or don't make it past seedling-hood.\\nKeep in mind that trees that come from seeds are not identical to the parent tree that they came from. Sometimes, the fruit that the new saplings produce is of a lesser quality. Other times, they do not produce edible fruit at all. This does not prevent the young tree from being visually pleasing. Keep this in mind when growing your tree.\\n\", 'Wash the seed to get rid of the slimy coating.:  You can do this by washing the lemon seed or by sucking on it until the coating is gone. This is important. The gel-like coating contains sugars, which can cause the seed to rot.\\nConsider leaving the lemon seeds in a cup of warm water overnight. This will help them sprout faster.\\n', 'Drop the seed into the hole and cover it up.:  Make sure that the pointy tip is pointing downward into the soil, and the rounded part is pointing upward towards you. The roots will come out of the pointy part.\\n', 'Cover the pot with a piece of breathable plastic to trap warmth and moisture.:  Begin by placing a sheet of clear plastic cling wrap over the pot. Wrap a rubber band around the plastic wrap to secure it to the pot. Poke a few holes into the plastic wrap. You can use a pencil, a toothpick, or even a fork. These holes will allow the plant to breathe.\\n\\n', 'Place the pot in a warm location.:  You can place the pot in a sunny location too, but sunlight is not vital at this point. In fact, too much sunlight can \"cook\" the young, delicate seedlings. You should see a sprout emerge in about two weeks.\\nThe ideal temperature is between 68\u00b0F and 82.4\u00b0F (20\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C).\\n', 'Water the soil when you see it become dry.:  The plastic wrap should trap the moisture, and the condensation should rain down onto the soil, making it damp again. In very dry environments, this may not happen. If you see the soil start to become dry, remove the plastic wrap and water the plant. Be sure to re-cover the pot with the plastic wrap when you are done watering.\\n\\n', 'Remove the plastic covering once the sprout appears and transfer the pot to a warm, sunny location.:  Remember to keep the soil damp, but do not let it become soggy. Click \\n', 'Dampen a paper towel and smooth it out on a flat surface.:  Start by soaking a paper towel with water, then squeeze out the excess water. Place the damp paper towel on a flat surface and smooth out any wrinkles.\\nThe paper towel should fit inside your plastic zippered or resealable bag. If the paper towel is too big, then fold it in half or into quarters.\\n', 'Pick out 5 to 10 plump seeds from an organic lemon.:  Seeds from non-organic lemons will not always sprout, so it is a good idea to prepare at least 10 seeds to ensure you have a healthy selection.\\nEven if you only plan on growing one lemon tree, it is a good idea to start with several seeds. Not all seeds will sprout, and not all seedlings will survive.\\nTake care to not crowd the seeds. They should be at least three inches apart, so that they have room for their roots as they germinate.\\n', 'Consider keeping the seeds in a cup of water overnight.:  This will keep the seeds from drying out while you work. The seeds must stay moist. If they dry out, they will not sprout.\\n\\n', 'Clean the gel-like coating off of each seed.:  You can do this by rinsing the seeds in cool water, or by sucking on them. This gel is filled with sugars, which can encourage mold and bacteria growth.\\n\\n', 'You can also peel the other white layer off to reveal a brown-colored seed.:  Start peeling from the pointy end. You can use your finger nail or a craft knife to nick the tip, and then peel the outer shell down. This will make it easier for the seeds to sprout and speed up the process, but is not necessary for germination to occur.\\n\\n', 'Peel the brown seed cover off as well.:  You may notice that your seed is covered with a thin, brown film. Use your fingernail to scratch this coating off.\\n\\n', \"Place the seeds onto the damp paper towel.:  Try to spread the seeds out as evenly as you can, so that the roots don't become tangled when they sprout.\\n\\n\", 'Repeat the peeling process for the rest of the seeds and place them down onto the towel.:  Once the seeds are on the paper towel, they should stay damp. If you notice them starting to get dry out, consider covering the paper towel with another damp paper towel, or folding the first one overtop of them.\\n\\n', \"Slip the paper towel into a plastic zippered or resealable bag, and close the bag tightly.:  Don't use a plastic grocery bag. You want the bag to be zippered or resealable; this will help trap the moisture and retain heat. Your seeds will need both in order to sprout.\\n\\n\", 'Keep the plastic bag in a dark, warm location until the seeds sprout.: ', 'Transplant the seedlings when the tails are about 3.15 inches (8 centimeters) long.: ', 'Move the pot to a warm, sunny location.:  Remember to water the plant and to keep the soil damp; do not allow the soil to become soggy or dry. Click \\n', \"Water your plant regularly, about 2 or 3 times per week.:  When the seedling has 4 developed leaves, let the surface of the soil become dry before you water again. Don't let the soil dry out completely, however; it should be moist if you stick your finger into it.\\n\", 'Make sure that it gets enough sunlight.:  Lemon trees require at least eight hours of sunlight. Seedlings will require 10 to 14 hours.\\n', \"Know when to transplant your seedling.:  Eventually, your seedling will outgrow its pot. When the seedling reaches 1 year old, transfer it to a 6 inch (15.24 centimeter) wide pot. Eventually, you will need to move your plant to a pot that is 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 centimeters) wide and 10 to 16 inches (25.4 to 40.64 centimeters) deep.\\nA good rule of thumb to determine when it's time to transplant is to look under the pot. If you can see roots through the drainage holes, it is time for a new, bigger pot.\\n\", 'Maintain the soil pH level.:  Lemon trees like soil that is slightly acidic. The pH should be between 5.7 and 6.5. You can measure this with a pH testing kit, which you can purchase from a gardening shop or a nursery. A good way to lower the acidity of the soil is by watering the plant once a month with some cold black coffee or tea (with no milk or sugar added).\\n', 'Remember to provide your tree with proper nutrients so that it grows healthy and strong.:  You can either dig a trench around the tree and fill it with dry compost, or you can water it with a water soluble fertilizer. Here are some ways in which you can provide your tree with the nutrition it needs:\\n\\nFertilize your lemon tree twice a year with an organic fertilizer, such as compost or vermicompost.\\nWater your plant every 2 to 4 weeks with a water soluble fertilizer. It should be high in potassium and magnesium.\\nIf your tree is going to stay indoors, purchase a general indoor plant fertilizer. It should contain micronutrients.\\nWater your tree once a month with a solution made from 1 tablespoon of Epsom salts and \u00bd gallon (1.89 liters) of water.\\n', \"Understand that it will take some time before your tree can bear fruit.:  Some lemon trees will produce fruit in as little as five years.

Here is a good way to identify them.","history":"None","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Get Rid of Spider Mites', 'description': \"\\nSpider mites (Class Arachnida) are tiny sap-sucking plant pests. They attack the underside of leaves and suck the vigor from the plant; with large infestations, they may even kill a plant. As soon as you spot an infestation, it's time to take charge and get rid of them! You can use biological control methods or chemical control methods to deal with a spider mite infestation.\\n\\n\", 'steps': [\"Look at the surface of the leaves.:  If your plant is indeed infested with spider mites, the leaves may have yellow blotches on them. When light falls on the leaves, you may see a silvered look or even streaks of bronze or silver.\\n\\nWhile mites usually attack the underside of leaves, they can sometimes get greedy and also eat the upper side of leaves and flowers. Eventually, the mites will suck holes right through the leaves - providing the most obvious evidence of infestation.\\nEven if you can't find holes in the leaves, your plant may still have spider mites, so keep an eye out for other signs of infestation.\\nOther signs of mite damage include distortion, deformation, wilting, spotting, streaking or discoloration on the surface of the leaves. If the mite damage gets particularly bad, the leaves may start to fall off.\\n\", 'Check for white webbing on the plant.:  This is a giveaway sign of some spider mites. The webbing usually clusters around feeding areas. Note that not all species of spider mite will produce webbing though.\\n\\n', 'Confirm the presence of spider mites.:  Spider mites are so  small, they can be very difficult to see. However, one method you can use to confirm their presence is to take a sheet of white paper, place it beneath the plant you suspect to be infested, and lightly shake the stem of one of the leaves.\\n\\nA certain number of the spider mites should fall onto the paper. They can be viewed more easily with a magnifying glass.\\nSpider mites come in a variety of colors, including red, green, yellow and brown. They have eight legs and tend to move quite slowly.\\nBe on the lookout for spider mites with spots on their backs - these are known as two-spotted spider mites and can be particularly hard to get rid of.\\n', 'Be particularly vigilant with certain species of plants.:  There are some plants which spider mites seem to favor more than others.\\n\\nIn particular, pay attention to possible infestations on miniature roses, fruit trees, bananas, potted begonias, beans, mint, broad-leafed weeds, strawberries, frangipani and indoor houseplants.\\nBe aware that the two-spotted spider mite has been known to infest over 100 different species of plants.\\n', 'Be especially alert during dry and dusty weather conditions.:  These are the conditions where spider mites can cause the most damage, as they are thirsty and are seeking moisture from the leaves of the plant. This also means they are very attracted to anything grown under glass, including plants sitting inside on your windowsills.\\n\\n', 'Remove badly infected parts of the plant immediately.:  Pick up any leaves that have fallen off the plant and pull off any badly damaged leaves from the plant itself. This will prevent the mites from affecting other plants nearby. Place the leaves in a sealed plastic bag and throw in the garbage or burn.\\n\\nIf an entire plant is infected, you should consider removing it completely. This will give other plants a better chance at survival.\\nWater affected plants only from above and keep removing any infected plant pieces as soon as you spot them.\\n', 'Wash and wipe indoor houseplants regularly.:  Given that it is fairly easy for the householder to clean indoor plants this way, it can be the most effective and non-toxic method to rid the plants of spider mites.\\n\\nYou can use either plain water or a solution of tepid (cool-warm) water mixed with a very mild dish detergent or soap. Use 3 tablespoons (44.4\\xa0ml) of soap per gallon of water.\\nUse a sponge soaked in the water to wipe down individual leaves of the plant, or place the water in a spray bottle and spritz the underside of the leaves.\\nApply the soap solution again, six days later, if the infestation continues. Be aware that some species of plant are particularly sensitive to soap, so consider testing the soap solution on a small section of the plant before spraying all over.\\n', 'Use plant-based miticides.:  There are a number of commercially available miticides which use natural ingredients to kill the spider mites, but leave the plant and other insects unharmed. The most popular ones are as follows:\\n\\nPyrethrum is a natural pesticide which is made from a plant closely related to the chrysanthemum. It is the best pesticide to start with when targeting spider mites, however some spider mite species have developed a resistance to it, so you should keep a close eye on plants even after spraying.\\nCinnamite is a non-hazardous pesticide derived from cinnamon oil. Although it is very safe to use and is effective for killing the spider mites themselves, it will not destroy the eggs. As a result, it will need to be used approximately every 3 days over a two week period, to ensure that all of the newly hatched eggs are killed also.\\nNeem oil is a miticide derived from the nuts of the Neem tree. It is great for targeting infestations, but also works well as a mite repellent and a treatment for powdery mildew.\\nRosemary oil is also effective as an organic pesticide. Try spraying a solution of rosemary oil and water onto the leaves of an infested plant. The rosemary oil will kill the spider mites, but leave the beneficial, predatory species of mites alone.\\n', 'Spray outdoor plants with a hose.:  Attach a spray nozzle to your outdoor hose and use it to water any infested outdoor plants. Set the water to a high pressure and try to target the underside of the leaves in particular. This should help to wash spider mites away.\\n\\n', 'Use a homemade herbal tea.:  If you want to make your own miticide at home, you can make an herbal tea by mixing a tablespoon of ground cinnamon, a tablespoon of ground cloves and two tablespoons of Italian seasoning in a quart of water.\\n\\nBring the water to a boil, then take off the heat. Once it has cooled slightly add 2 tablespoons (29.6\\xa0ml) of crushed fresh garlic. Leave to sit until the water cools completely, then strain through a cloth or coffee filter.\\nAdd a squirt of dish soap to the tea, then pour into a spray bottle. Spray the underside of the infested leaves with the tea every three days over a two week period. This should effectively kill the mites.\\n', 'Try organic salts.:  Fatty acids or potassium salts can be abrasive against mite bodies. Apply these late afternoon, to give the maximum time for the wetness to remain on the plants, to get to the mites. \\n\\nMist susceptible plants with water in the evening to make the environment cooler and more moist. This works well for the two-spotted spider mites which prefer warm and dry environments.\\n', \"Control weeds around plants.:  Don't give mites extra hiding places and launchpads to attack the plants that you actually want to grow in the garden.\\n\\nIn particular, remove all broad-leafed weeds.\\nRemove all debris remaining after harvest. This includes removing plant stumps, fallen leaves and any other plant matter.\\n\", \"Encourage the presence of ladybugs and other insects that prey on spider mites.:  Predator insects, such as lacewing larvae, predacious thrips and ladybugs can decimate spider mite populations if encouraged to stay in your garden. However, one of the main reasons that spider mite populations develop in the first place is the use of pesticides which kill their natural predators. Therefore, you should avoid using pesticides such as carbaryl, malathion and imidacloprid.\\nThese insects can be purchased online, from garden centers or through advertisements in gardening magazines. Alternatively, herbs such as amaranth and borage can naturally attract ladybugs into your garden.\\nAsk the supplier for details on how to make the most of using predator insects, noting that you'll have less success if using them in a mixed planting area.\\nPredatory mites can also be used against spider mites. Look for\\nUnder the right conditions, predatory mites can decimate a spider mite population. Interestingly, ladybugs (or ladybirds) will leave predatory mites alone, targeting just the spider mites!\\n\", \"Use rubbing alcohol.:  Isopropyl rubbing alcohol will effectively kill spider mites. Simply pour a little of the rubbing alcohol onto a clean cloth and use it to wipe the underside of the infested plant's leaves.\\n\\n\", \"Purchase a proprietary product suitable for outdoor spider mites.:  There are sprays or wipes available from garden centers and hardware stores. Use according to the manufacturer's instructions.\\n\\nIf spraying specific chemicals (such as dienochlor, dicofol, azocyclotin, fenbutatin, bromopropylate, propagate), it is recommended that you do not use the same product more than three times per growing season. This will help reduce the chances of the mites gaining resistance against the chemicals.\\n\", 'Try getting rid of the mites with liquid sulfur.:  Spraying liquid sulfur is another option for getting rid of spider mites. Do not use powdered sulfur because it can get into the air and you or someone else might inhale it. Make sure that you do not spray liquid sulfur within 30 days of using an oil on your plants or in temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"spider mites are so  small, they can be very difficult to see","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"How do spider mites look like?

Also place these traps against the walls and in corners in high traffic areas.\\nPlace sticky traps in the same areas you place bait stations.\\nDo not spray sticky traps and bait stations with insecticides or cleaning products. These will contaminate the baits. If the bait is contaminated, then the roaches will not enter.\\n', 'Use a duster bulb to apply the acid.:  A duster bulb will enable you to apply a thin layer of boric acid. Squeeze the bulb to puff a small layer of powder along the floor and walls in your kitchen and bathroom. The layer should be barely visible to your eye. Do not apply too much boric acid.

Boric acid is also an effective way to kill German roaches. If the infestation is severe, then you may need to use a combination of methods to kill the roaches. Place the bait in dark spaces in your kitchen and bathroom, such as behind the refrigerator, oven, and toilet, and inside kitchen and bathroom cabinets.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Use gel baits.:  This type of bait comes in a tube and is applied by squeezing the tube to dispense the gel. Apply the gel along window and door trims, behind the trashcan, and along the cabinet doors in your kitchen and bathroom. Also apply bait gel under sinks where the drainpipe enters the wall in your kitchen and bathroom.\\nApply gel bait in the crevices and cracks of your kitchen drawers, and along upper shelving and baseboards.\\nIf you have children or pets, then make sure to apply the gel in areas that are out of their reach.\\n', 'Try a bait station.:  Bait stations consist of a plastic housing that contains poison.

Unlike conventional hats that go over your head, a fascinator should look like it is balancing on your head. You can purchase a fascinator, but making your own is so much more fun! Choose items for your base, accents, and centerpiece to create a headpiece that is unique and stylish.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Cut out a 3 to 5\\xa0in (7.6 to 12.7\\xa0cm) circle of felt.:  Go with a smaller-sized base if you want a dainty fascinator, or opt for a larger base for something more dramatic. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut out the circle. You may want to use a circular object, such as a bowl or cup to trace a circle onto the felt before you cut it out.\\nYou can cut the felt into a different shape if you prefer, such as a teardrop, oval, triangle, square, or star.\\n', 'Add 1 or more layers of mesh or tulle to cover up the felt circle.:  You can do 1 layer for sheer covering of the felt circle, or add more layers for extra coverage and volume. Thread a needle with a matching color thread, and then tie a knot in the end. Lay the desired amount of tulle or mesh over the felt circle and sew along the outer edges of the felt to attach the tulle to the base.\\nYou can cut out mesh or tulle to the same size as the base, or cut out larger pieces and drape them over the base.\\n', 'Layer feathers around the felt circle to create a feathery base.:  You can cover the felt with feathers if you want to make that the backdrop for other items on your fascinator. Apply a dot of hot glue to the felt and press a feather into it. Hold the feather in place for about 10 to 15 seconds. Repeat to add more feathers to the felt base.\\nUse feathers in colors that complement the felt base if you will not be covering it completely, such as pink dyed feathers with a pink felt circle, or peacock feathers with a green felt base.\\nBe careful not to touch the hot glue! It can burn you if it gets on your skin.\\n', 'Glue fringe around the felt base to hide the edges.:  If you want to ensure that the edges of the felt base will not be visible, try adding a fringe trim. Apply hot glue to the outer edges of the felt circle. Then, press fringe trim into the hot glue going all the way around the circle.\\nChoose fringe that will complement the other colors in your design, such as black fringe for a black felt base with red silk flowers.\\n', 'Create ribbon loops and glue them onto your base.:  Grasp the end of a piece of ribbon and fold it over about 2 to 3\\xa0in (5.1 to 7.6\\xa0cm) from the end. Then, repeat this as many times as you like to create more loops. Once you have the desired number of loops, staple through the ribbon layers at 1 end to secure the loops.\\nYou may also use ribbon that has wire in it for a 3-D effect. Shape the ribbon into loops or waves and then glue the ribbon onto your fascinator base.\\n', 'Attach a spray of feathers that match or complement your other colors.:  Choose a single long feather, or a bundle of feathers to attach to the center of your fascinator. Apply hot glue to the bare ends of the feather to attach them to the fascinator base. Direct the feathers so that the ends are going towards the back or top of your head.\\nYou may position the spray of feathers so that the bare ends are at the center of your base or off to one side slightly. Try putting the base on your head and holding the feathers in a few different positions first to see what looks best to you.\\n', 'Select a silk flower for an easy pre-made centerpiece.:  You can purchase silk flowers in almost any variety in a craft supply store or online. Choose a silk flower in the color and style that will complement the other elements in your fascinator. Cut off the stem so that the bottom of the flower is flat. Then, apply hot glue to the back of the flower and press it into your base.\\nYou can position the silk flower in the center or off to 1 side.\\nFor an extra flowery fascinator, try surrounding the silk flower with other smaller ones, or layering petals around the main flower. You could also add silk leaves and trail a vine off 1 side of the fascinator.\\n', 'Glue on beads, sequins, paste-gems, or buttons to accent your base.:  You can glue on a single large bead, sequin, or button as a centerpiece, or use a variety of smaller beads, sequins, and buttons to accent your fascinator. Apply a dot of hot glue where you want to attach a bead, sequin, or button, and then press the item into the hot glue and hold for about 10 to 15 seconds.\\nTo avoid burning your fingers on the hot glue, try pressing the item in place with the back of a pen or pencil.\\n', 'Opt for a headband or large metal hair clip to secure your fascinator base.:  These types of fascinator bases will provide the most stability. Opt for a 1\\xa0in (2.5\\xa0cm) or wider headband or a 3\\xa0in (7.6\\xa0cm) hair clip. Avoid using combs and small clips because these may not be strong enough to keep the fascinator on your head.\\nMake sure the headband or hair clip does not have any bumps, glitter, or other items on its surface that might make it hard to glue your fascinator in place. Opt for a plain, smooth-surfaced headband or hair clip.\\nTry on the headband first to ensure that it is snug, but not too tight. A headband with texture on the underside will work best for keeping the fascinator on your head.\\n', 'Apply a thick line of hot glue to the top of the headband or hair clip.:  If using a headband, apply enough glue to cover the diameter of your felt base, and position the line of glue so that it is slightly off to the side you want to wear the fascinator on.\\nFor example, if you want to wear the fascinator so it tilts to the right, apply the line of glue starting at the center of the headband and going to the right.\\nDo not apply hot glue to the inside of the hair clip, or you may not be able to reopen it.\\n', 'Press the felt disc onto the headband or barrette.:  Press the bottom of the felt disc onto the line of glue on the headband immediately after you apply it.

","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Make a Fascinator', 'description': '\\nA fascinator is a bold, fashionable headpiece that you wear near the front of your head and slightly to one side. Unlike conventional hats that go over your head, a fascinator should look like it is balancing on your head. You can purchase a fascinator, but making your own is so much more fun! Choose items for your base, accents, and centerpiece to create a headpiece that is unique and stylish.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Cut out a 3 to 5\\xa0in (7.6 to 12.7\\xa0cm) circle of felt.:  Go with a smaller-sized base if you want a dainty fascinator, or opt for a larger base for something more dramatic. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut out the circle. You may want to use a circular object, such as a bowl or cup to trace a circle onto the felt before you cut it out.\\nYou can cut the felt into a different shape if you prefer, such as a teardrop, oval, triangle, square, or star.\\n', 'Add 1 or more layers of mesh or tulle to cover up the felt circle.:  You can do 1 layer for sheer covering of the felt circle, or add more layers for extra coverage and volume. Thread a needle with a matching color thread, and then tie a knot in the end. Lay the desired amount of tulle or mesh over the felt circle and sew along the outer edges of the felt to attach the tulle to the base.\\nYou can cut out mesh or tulle to the same size as the base, or cut out larger pieces and drape them over the base.\\n', 'Layer feathers around the felt circle to create a feathery base.:  You can cover the felt with feathers if you want to make that the backdrop for other items on your fascinator. Apply a dot of hot glue to the felt and press a feather into it. Hold the feather in place for about 10 to 15 seconds. Repeat to add more feathers to the felt base.\\nUse feathers in colors that complement the felt base if you will not be covering it completely, such as pink dyed feathers with a pink felt circle, or peacock feathers with a green felt base.\\nBe careful not to touch the hot glue! It can burn you if it gets on your skin.\\n', 'Glue fringe around the felt base to hide the edges.:  If you want to ensure that the edges of the felt base will not be visible, try adding a fringe trim. Apply hot glue to the outer edges of the felt circle. Then, press fringe trim into the hot glue going all the way around the circle.\\nChoose fringe that will complement the other colors in your design, such as black fringe for a black felt base with red silk flowers.\\n', 'Create ribbon loops and glue them onto your base.:  Grasp the end of a piece of ribbon and fold it over about 2 to 3\\xa0in (5.1 to 7.6\\xa0cm) from the end. Then, repeat this as many times as you like to create more loops. Once you have the desired number of loops, staple through the ribbon layers at 1 end to secure the loops.\\nYou may also use ribbon that has wire in it for a 3-D effect. Shape the ribbon into loops or waves and then glue the ribbon onto your fascinator base.\\n', 'Attach a spray of feathers that match or complement your other colors.:  Choose a single long feather, or a bundle of feathers to attach to the center of your fascinator. Apply hot glue to the bare ends of the feather to attach them to the fascinator base. Direct the feathers so that the ends are going towards the back or top of your head.\\nYou may position the spray of feathers so that the bare ends are at the center of your base or off to one side slightly. Try putting the base on your head and holding the feathers in a few different positions first to see what looks best to you.\\n', 'Select a silk flower for an easy pre-made centerpiece.:  You can purchase silk flowers in almost any variety in a craft supply store or online. Choose a silk flower in the color and style that will complement the other elements in your fascinator. Cut off the stem so that the bottom of the flower is flat. Then, apply hot glue to the back of the flower and press it into your base.\\nYou can position the silk flower in the center or off to 1 side.\\nFor an extra flowery fascinator, try surrounding the silk flower with other smaller ones, or layering petals around the main flower. You could also add silk leaves and trail a vine off 1 side of the fascinator.\\n', 'Glue on beads, sequins, paste-gems, or buttons to accent your base.:  You can glue on a single large bead, sequin, or button as a centerpiece, or use a variety of smaller beads, sequins, and buttons to accent your fascinator. Apply a dot of hot glue where you want to attach a bead, sequin, or button, and then press the item into the hot glue and hold for about 10 to 15 seconds.\\nTo avoid burning your fingers on the hot glue, try pressing the item in place with the back of a pen or pencil.\\n', 'Opt for a headband or large metal hair clip to secure your fascinator base.:  These types of fascinator bases will provide the most stability. Opt for a 1\\xa0in (2.5\\xa0cm) or wider headband or a 3\\xa0in (7.6\\xa0cm) hair clip. Avoid using combs and small clips because these may not be strong enough to keep the fascinator on your head.\\nMake sure the headband or hair clip does not have any bumps, glitter, or other items on its surface that might make it hard to glue your fascinator in place. Opt for a plain, smooth-surfaced headband or hair clip.\\nTry on the headband first to ensure that it is snug, but not too tight. A headband with texture on the underside will work best for keeping the fascinator on your head.\\n', 'Apply a thick line of hot glue to the top of the headband or hair clip.:  If using a headband, apply enough glue to cover the diameter of your felt base, and position the line of glue so that it is slightly off to the side you want to wear the fascinator on.\\nFor example, if you want to wear the fascinator so it tilts to the right, apply the line of glue starting at the center of the headband and going to the right.\\nDo not apply hot glue to the inside of the hair clip, or you may not be able to reopen it.\\n', 'Press the felt disc onto the headband or barrette.:  Press the bottom of the felt disc onto the line of glue on the headband immediately after you apply it. Hot glue dries quickly! Hold the felt base tightly against the headband or hair clip for about 30 seconds to ensure that it is completely dry.\\nYour fascinator is complete after the glue is dry!

If your tree is indoors, put it next to a large window so that it can get adequate sunlight.\\nThe ideal temperature for banana growth is 26-30\u00b0C (78-86\u00b0F).\\nIf the temperature is below 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), most banana trees will stop growing.\\n\", \"Prune your tree.:  After 6-8 weeks of sustained, healthy growth, your banana tree will have to be pruned. When banana trees grow, suckers will start to form on your plant. Your goal is to eliminate all but one of the suckers from your banana tree. Choose the healthiest and largest sucker from your plant and use gardening shears to cut off the rest of the suckers from the corm. When your tree starts to grow fruit it will need to be pruned again. After harvesting the fruit, cut down the tree so it's 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) from the ground, without damaging the main sucker. The tree will grow more fruit after you prune it.\\n\\nSuckers will look like shoots that grow out of the corm and have leaves.\\nReplanting the additional suckers will grow a new banana tree but you must retain some of the roots from the banana corm.\\n\", \"Bring your tree inside when the temperature drops below 57\\xa0\u00b0F (14\\xa0\u00b0C).:  Cold and heavy winds aren't healthy for your banana plant and can disrupt the growth of fruit. If you know that your yard will have cold winds, consider bringing your banana plant inside, or insulating it with rows of trees.\\nYour banana trees will start dying at 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C).\\n\", 'Transfer your banana tree when it outgrows its container.:  Transplant your tree to a larger container before it becomes root-bound. You can tell when your tree is ready for a larger container when it stops growing vertically.\\nIf your tree is not coming out, you may need to tap on the sides of the container.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Well-drained soil', 'Baby banana tree or banana corm', '6 inch (15 cm) or 8 inch (20 cm) pot', 'Spade or shovel', 'Watering can or hose', 'Fertilizer', 'Gardening shears']}","extracted_answer":"banana trees thrive in indirect sunlight and prefer shaded areas","question_type":"['causal']","text_question":"Can you clarify why the banana tree can't be in direct sunlight?","question_id":"diy-180-9","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-182","question":"Why do I need to clean the filters?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Clean-a-K%26N-Air-Filter","data_split":"validation","original_answer":"For the same reason you need to clean anything, ie because it is dirty.

To save money, keep your old takeout containers for this purpose. You could also use one an old plastic salad container. Make sure the container has holes at the bottom for drainage.\\nIf you prefer, you could pick up some propagation trays from your local garden center, which are designed for this purpose.\\n', 'Get your soil.:  Purchase some quality potting soil from your local home and garden center so that your microgreens have a nutritious environment to grow in.

If using coconut coir, fill each container with three quarters potting soil and one quarter coconut coir.\\nYou can also pick up some vermiculite to use at the planting stage. Vermiculite is a mineral that also helps with seed propagation.\\n', 'Set up your light source.:  If you are growing in a warm climate and have lots of light in your house, simply place your tray of microgreens beside a sunny window. However, if you are growing microgreens indoors and do not have much light in your house, you will need a grow light. If you use artificial light, you should place the light four inches above your tray of microgreens.

You don\u2019t want to bury them completely.\\n', 'Spray the seeds with a mister.:  You should mist your greens once per day. If you are not sure whether they need water, stick your finger a half inch into the soil. If the soil is dry, they need to be watered. If it is damp, the seeds should be happy. If it is extremely wet or marshy, you may be drowning your microgreens.\\n', 'Cover the microgreens to create a small greenhouse.:  If you are using propagation tray, simply place another tray on top of the one you are using. If you are using a takeout or other container, you could cover it with a plastic bag. Make sure you put a few holes in the plastic bag so that the seeds don\u2019t suffocate.\\n', 'Wait for your seeds to germinate.:  It should take about a week for the seeds to germinate. A couple days after germination, take off the cover to expose the seeds to more light. Let them grow for two to four weeks before harvesting, depending on the type of microgreen. \\n\\n', 'Cut the base of the microgreens with kitchen scissors.:  You know they are ready to harvest when they are one to three inches in height. At harvest time, cut the base of the microgreens, just above the soil. Since they are tiny and grow close together, you should be able to cut a whole bunch at once. One or two clippings should be enough for a salad or sandwich.\\n\\nIt will take anywhere from two to four weeks for your microgreens to mature.\\n', 'Wash the microgreens.:  You can wash your microgreens under tap water. Dry them in a salad spinner or with a clean towel.\\n\\n', 'Add the microgreens to your sandwiches or burgers.:  A handful of microgreens such as spring onion or radish microgreens tastes great on a burger. Once you have all of your usual ingredients on the burger or sandwich, simply throw on a handful of microgreens.\\nFor instance, salmon burgers taste great with microgreens.\\nYou could also throw some microgreens on your tacos.\\n', 'Put some microgreens in your salad.:  The next time you are making a green salad, throw some microgreens on top for some extra flavor. Swiss chard, beet and radish microgreens are among the most flavorful in salads.\\nFor instance, you could make a rainbow beet and pistachio salad with microgreens.\\n', 'Throw some microgreens inside your favorite omelette.:  If you are making a spinach omelette, for instance, you could add the microgreens at the same time as the spinach.\\nIf you are making an egg white omelette with avocado and goat cheese, microgreens are a wonderful addition.\\n', 'Store the remaining microgreens in a glass of water.:  If you have any remaining microgreens after your harvest, you can put them in a glass of water in the fridge. Place a quarter inch of water in a cup and then add your leftover greens. They will stay fresh a little longer if you store them in a cup of water. The next time you are craving greens, grab your leftovers instead of harvesting more microgreens.\\nYou should not fully submerge the microgreens in the water. Rather, you just want the roots and the bottom of the stems to be submerged in the water.\\nMonitor your greens closely for any sign of decay or rot.

However, washing your grinder isn\u2019t really any different than washing other cookware. Properly storing its parts afterward will help ensure that it\u2019s well maintained (and thus less likely to make a mess when used). Following a few additional pointers when using it will also help ensure an easy clean-up.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Start cleaning immediately after use.:  Expect meat to leave oil and grease behind as it passes through your grinder (as well as stray bits of meat). These will dry and crust over if given time, so don\u2019t wait too long before cleaning up. Make life easier by dealing with it promptly after each use.\\n', 'Feed bread into the grinder.:  Before you disassemble the machine, grab two or three slices of bread. Feed them through the grinder just as you did with your meat. Use these to absorb the meat\u2019s oil and grease, as well as push out any stray bits that are lingering inside the machine.\\n\\n', 'Disassemble the grinder.:  First, unplug the machine if it\u2019s electric. Then break it down into its parts. These may vary according to type and model, but generally a meat grinder consists of:\\nA pusher, feed tube, and hopper (usually a single piece through which the meat is fed into the machine).\\nA screw (an internal piece that forces the meat through the machine)\\nA blade\\nA plate or die (the metal piece with holes where the meat comes out)\\nA cover for the blade and plate\\n', 'Soak the parts.:  Fill a sink or bucket with warm water and add some dish detergent. Place the disassembled parts inside once full. Let them sit for about a quarter of an hour to loosen up any remaining grease, oil, or meat.\\n\\nIf your grinder is an electric model, do not soak any motorized parts. Instead, use this time to wipe down the outside of the base with a damp cloth and then a fresh one to dry it.\\n', 'Scrub the parts.:  Use a sponge to clean the screw, cover, and blade. Be careful when handling the blade, since this is sharp and can easily cut you if mishandled. Switch to a bottle brush to clean the inside of the feed tube, hopper, and the plate\u2019s holes. Rinse each part with clean water when finished.\\n\\nDon\u2019t rush through this process. You want to remove all traces so you don\u2019t end up with a breeding ground for germs and bacteria. So once you think you\u2019ve scrubbed something enough, scrub it just a little bit more.\\n', 'Dry the parts.:  First, wipe them down with a dry towel to get rid of excess water. Then lay them on a fresh towel or wire rack to air-dry. Avoid rust and oxidation by waiting until they are totally dry before putting your grinder away.\\n\\n', 'Oil any metal parts.:  Keep your grinder well lubricated and prevent rust from forming during storage. Fill a spray bottle with food-grade mineral oil. Then mist all of your grinder\u2019s metal parts (excluding an electric parts) with an even coat of oil.\\nPay particular attention to the pusher and screw, since these come into the most contact with your meat as you feed it through the machine.\\n', 'Bag each part individually with rice.:  Place each part to your grinder in its own sealable plastic bag. Then add a handful of rice to each bag. The rice isn\u2019t strictly necessary, but it will absorb any present and future moisture, which makes it a good idea if you store your parts in the freezer and\/or live in an area with high humidity.\\n\\n', 'Store in your freezer if possible.:  Keep in mind that your grinder works best when its parts are cold. Keep any non-electric parts in the freezer if there\u2019s space. However, if you can\u2019t devote that much space for long-term storage, don\u2019t worry. Instead:\\n\\nStore your parts somewhere dry in the meantime. Then simply place them in the freezer long enough to chill them before your next use (roughly an hour).\\n', 'Sterilize oiled parts with bleach before use.:  Mix a tablespoon of bleach with one gallon (3.8 L) of water. Fill a spray bottle with this solution. Then spray each metal part that you oiled before storage to ensure that they are disinfected. Then thoroughly rinse them with clean water to remove all traces of bleach.\\n', 'Keep parts and meat cold.:  Expect warm meat to make a bigger mess when you\u2019re grinding it. Make clean-up easier by keeping both the meat and the grinder\u2019s parts well chilled before use. If you need to grind the same meat multiple times:\\nFill a large bowl with ice. Place a second bowl inside the first and grind your meat into that. Repeat as needed to keep the meat relatively chilled between each grind.\\n', 'Slice off sinew before grinding.:  Expect any sinew in your meat to dull your grinder\u2019s blade over time. Carefully cut this away with a knife or cleaver before feeding the meat into your grinder. Ensure a better grind (and thus less mess to clean up inside).\\n', 'Sharpen or replace blades as needed.:  Remember: a dull blade will create a bigger mess inside. If your machine seems to be consistently smearing meat around instead of grinding it into small pieces, sharpen the blade or replace it with a new one. However:\\nAs long you keep your grinder well maintained and avoid feeding sinew into it, the blade should get sharper and sharper the more you use it. At most, you should only need to sharpen or replace it annually, if that.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['2 or 3 slices of bread', 'Sink or bucket', 'Warm water', 'Dish soap', 'Cloth', 'Sponge', 'Bottle brush', 'Towels', 'Spray bottle', 'Food-grade mineral oil', 'Rice', 'Sealable plastic bags', 'Freezer (optional)', 'Bleach']}","extracted_answer":"keep your grinder well lubricated","question_type":"['complex']","text_question":"Do I wipe the oil off after applying it or just leave it on?","question_id":"diy-203-4","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"return_list_ingredients_tools"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-206","question":"Does it matter what kind of dish soap?

Try cleaner, bleach, solvent, and baking soda to remove stains.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Scrub the stone with dish soap.:  Dish detergent works well for a basic cleaning. Mix a couple of drops of dish soap with warm water in a large bucket. Use a push broom with thick, tough bristles to apply the soap to the stone. Push the broom over the stone until it\u2019s covered in suds, then rinse with a hose.\\nDon\u2019t use a wire broom or a brush with wire bristles on a stone patio.

Add less water for a stronger solution to help with deep stains. Spray the vinegar solution over the stone and let it sit for half an hour. Then scrub with a nylon brush.\\nMop the area afterwards to help remove the excess water and vinegar.\\n', 'Use a pressure washer on tough grime.:  Use the nozzle setting so the water sprays in a fan instead of a jet. Stand a few feet away from the stone with the pressure washer so you don\u2019t break off part of the stone or causing it to flake.\\nSpray the pressure washer across the joints and not up and down the joints.\\nMake sure not to use a pressure washer too often on the stone patio because it can hurt the stone. Only use a pressure washer once per season to protect the integrity of your stone.\\n', 'Use a soft nylon brush and cleaner to remove stains.:  Apply a deck cleaner, degreaser, or stain remover to the stain. Rub the stain with a soft nylon brush. Add more pressure if the stain isn\u2019t being removed. Rinse the cleaner with water.\\n', 'Use oxygenated bleach to clean the stones.:  Oxygenated bleach contains sodium carbonate and mixes with water to create oxygen. Mix the four scoops of oxygenated bleach with warm or hot water until it is fully dissolved in a five gallon bucket. Pour the solvent over dry stone in sections.

Mix equal parts bleach with water in a bucket or watering can. Cover the stone with it. Let it sit for around 10 minutes, then brush the stains with a broom. Rinse it well with clean water. You should probably rinse multiple times.\\nUse thin, plain bleach for this. Don't use bleach that has added detergents and other chemicals. These thicker formulas with added ingredients don't clean as well and may clump on the stone. Just buy basic bleach.\\nBleach can kill plants if the solution touches it.\\n\", 'Try baking soda to remove stains.:  Baking soda has an abrasive structure that can help remove stains. You can mix baking soda with vinegar, or two parts bleach with three parts baking soda to make a stain-removing paste. Cover the stain with the paste and then use the brush to scrub the stain.\\nRinse the paste with clean water.\\n', 'Sweep the stones often.:  Use a soft nylon broom to brush off the stones. This removes dirt and debris, along with helping dislodge weeds that may be growing between the stones. Try doing this at least once a week.\\n', 'Use sand between the stones to protect them.:  Polymeric sand can be used between the stones to help maintain them throughout the season. Sand can keep weeds from growing between the stones, so you don\u2019t have to keep pulling them up every month. You can buy polymeric sand at home improvement stores.\\nSand can also help bugs from raising between the stones and making their way through the patio to your house.\\n', 'Cover the patio with a surface protector during the winter months.:  Surface protector can help keep moss and dirt from collecting on surfaces during the winter months. You can also treat your stone patio with surface protector at the beginning of the season to help keep dirt off the stone.\\nYou mix this solution with water and spray it on the stone. Follow the directions on the bottle to mix the proper ratio of solution to water. This should be done every four months.\\nYou can find patio and stone surface protector solution at home improvement stores.\\n', 'Mix a vinegar solution to kill weeds.:  Fill a spray bottle with distilled white vinegar.

I've share the step here.","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Identify Black Mold', 'description': '\\nMolds are commonly found in nature and help to break down the nutrients in soil. Inside, molds are potentially hazardous to your health. One common mold is stachybotrys atra, or black mold. While research on the effects of black mold remains somewhat limited, some existing research shows that inhaled mold, in general, can negatively affect conditions like asthma, particularly for individuals with mold allergy.[1]\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n Black mold is commonly thought to be toxic when ingested or inhaled; however, it is no more dangerous than other types of mold. If you notice any signs mold, it is not necessary to identify the species, but if you do want to identify the mold, there are a few ways to go about it. First, do a sweep of your building to look in all mold prone areas to find any mold. Next, have a professional inspection done to identify black mold.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Pay attention to any smells in your building.:  Black mold has a mildew or musty smell. If your building smells like this, try to follow the smell to the source of the mold. If you cannot see the mold, it may be behind a wall or in another well covered space.\\n', 'Observe the color of the mold.:  Black mold is, well, black. Other molds are often white, green, yellow, or any number of colors, and they can be dangerous, too. Also note that black mold commonly refers to stachybotrys atra, but there are other molds that are black in color.\\nStachybotrys atra can also be found in colors other than black.\\n', 'Note the texture of the mold.:  Black mold will have a wet, slimy texture. Other molds can have a light, fuzzy texture. Avoid touching the mold with your bare hand. Observe the texture by wiping the mold with a towel or other material.\\n', 'Seek out naturally damp areas.:  Mold typically grows in well-saturated areas. Basements, bathrooms, kitchens, and garages are commonly invaded by black mold. If you suspect mold in your building, start looking in the rooms that hold the most water.\\n', 'Inspect any leaks.:  Even if an area is not normally water-prone, a leak can lead to mold. Leaky water pipes are often culprits, but you can have other sources of water, too. If your air conditioner is not properly drained and insulated, it can leak water. This can result in black mold around the leak.\\n', 'Look at joints.:  Porous materials such as grout are often used to join two slabs or panels. For example, kitchen and bathroom tiles often have grout between them. If water frequently gets into the pores in the grout, black mold can grow there.\\n', 'Check any seals.:  Sealants can also be prone to growing black mold. Sealants are often used in high moisture areas (e.g. around your shower). Because of this, black mold can set up and grown on a sealant, such as calk.\\n', 'Watch materials high in cellulose.:  Black mold naturally grows on materials containing cellulose. These are plant based materials such as paper, cardboard, and wood. Keep a close eye on any paneling or file cabinets that get wet. Any wood, drywall, carpet, or cloth can easily grow black mold under moist conditions.\\n', 'Have an inspection done.:  Call a local business that offers mold removal services. Many professionals will do a mold inspection for free. If no mold is found, there is no cost to you. If the inspector finds mold, they can help you remove it.\\n', 'Hire a professional for mold removal.:  Large amounts of black mold may be difficult for an untrained person to remove. If any area is missed, the mold spores can recolonize and the mold will grow back quickly. A trained professional will ensure that the entire area is mold-free.\\n', 'Stay safe around black mold.:  Mold spores can be dangerous if inhaled or ingested, but this varies person to person. Allergies are typically responsible for a person\u2019s reaction to mold. To be on the safe side, wear a mask and gloves. Be sure that you clean the entire area to get rid of any microscopic spores that could start a new colony of mold.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"professional will ensure that the entire area is mold-free","question_type":"['causal']","text_question":"Why shouldn't I just take care of it myself?","question_id":"diy-217-1","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"ask_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-222","question":"What is the board going to be used for?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Stamp-Leather","data_split":"validation","original_answer":"You will be stamping the leather on the hardboard ","history":"student: What tools will I need to learn to stamp leather? | teacher: You need at least five tools, starting with a board ","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Stamp Leather', 'description': \"\\nLeather stamping can be a fun project to create things like leather name tags and more.

After washing, hang your socks out to dry to keep them from becoming damaged.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Separate the socks by color.:  Before washing your socks, you\u2019ll want to separate them into two loads: whites and colors. This keeps your socks looking vibrant and prevents any unwanted bleeding. \\n\\nIf you\u2019re washing both dress socks and athletic socks, consider separating those as well. For example, you might have a load of colored dress socks, colored athletic socks, white dress socks, and white athletic socks. You may also wish to separate socks by material. For instance, consider washing wool socks separately from cotton and cotton-blend socks.\\nIf you only have a few pairs of white athletic socks to wash, throw them into the washing machine with any white towels that you have.\\n', 'Use stain removing products to remove stains.:  There are many products out there, such as Tide Ultra Stain Release Liquid, aimed to get rid of stains. Purchase a stain remover and follow the directions on the bottle. It may instruct you to either soak your stained socks in the remover or apply the remover directly to the stains.\\nMix a scoop of Oxiclean powder into a gallon (3.8 L) of warm water and soak your stained socks for a few hours, or overnight if you\u2019re dealing with a tougher stain. Then wash the stained socks.\\n', 'Try removing stains with home remedies.:  There are also many home remedies that you can try to get rid of different kinds of stains. Try sprinkling salt onto red wine stains or spraying hairspray onto ink stains before washing.\\nMake a generic stain remover at home by mixing a 1:2 ratio of dish washing liquid and hydrogen peroxide.\\n', 'Turn the socks inside out.:  Doing this allows the socks to be cleaned as thoroughly as possible, because the odor-causing bacteria mostly reside inside of the sock.\\n', 'Pin each pair together with a clothespin.:  If you often find yourself with single socks, consider pinning each pair together with a clothespin before putting them in the washing machine. This way, they\u2019ll stay paired throughout the washing process and they\u2019ll be easier to put away afterward.\\n', 'Wash the socks on gentle with cold water and mild soap.:  Put a load of dirty socks in the washing machine. Set the machine to gentle, press start, and pour in a mild laundry detergent to prevent fading, stretching, and other types of wear and tear. \\n\\n', 'Turn the socks right side out.:  Take the socks out of the washing machine. Feed the sock back through itself and gently pull it straight so that it\u2019s right side in. Do this carefully to avoid stretching out the fabric. \\n\\n', 'Sort your socks.:  Divide your socks into two piles; one of colored socks and one of white socks. Wash each one separately so that the colors don\u2019t bleed into the white socks. This will also help to keep the colored socks from fading. \\n\\nIf you\u2019re washing both athletic socks and dress socks, you may want to separate them as well in order to prevent damage.\\n', 'Remove any stains with removers or home remedies.:  Purchase a stain remover and follow the directions on the bottle, whether you\u2019re instructed soak the sock or apply the remover to the stain directly. You can also try to remove stains by using different home remedies. For example, try applying hot vinegar or baking soda to grass stains.\\n', 'Fill a sink with cold, soapy water.:  Plug the drain of a sink and start filling the sink with cold water from the faucet. Warm water may cause bleeding and\/or shrinking.\\nUse a bathtub instead of a sink if you have a large load of socks to wash.\\nUse a natural, non-toxic laundry detergent as conventional detergents can add a chemical film that creates dinginess in clothing over time.\\n', 'Flip the socks inside out.:  The inside of the sock is the part that needs to be cleaned most thoroughly. Keeping the socks inside out while hand washing them will help to eliminate as much odor-causing bacteria as possible.\\n', 'Swish the socks around in the water.:  Swirl the socks through the water with your hands to loosen the dirt and ensure a more thorough clean. Avoid scrubbing and\/or twisting the fabric, as this can cause stretching and damage.\\n', 'Soak the socks for 5 minutes.:  Leave the socks alone for at least 5 minutes so that they can soak in the soapy water. If the socks are especially dirty, drain the water, fill the sink up again with soapy water, and keep the socks submerged for 10-30 minutes.\\n', 'Rinse the socks out.:  Pull the drain and let the dirty water go down. Then turn the faucet back on cold and rinse out all of the soap by holding the socks underneath.\\n', 'Flip the socks right side out.:  Flip the fabric back to the way it was initially once the sock is clean. Be careful not to stretch out the sock when you do this. \\n\\n', 'Roll the socks in a towel and press the water out.:  Lay your socks out flat on a towel, roll the towel up tightly, and press the water out by pushing down on it. Do this before hanging the socks up to quicken the drying process.\\n\\nDon\u2019t wring the socks out, as this may stretch and damage the fabric.\\n', 'Hang the socks out to dry.:  The best way to dry your socks is by hanging them on a clothes rack or out on a clothes line.

Planting clones of marijuana plants is a simple process that only requires a few steps. Choose clean pots with new soil and provide a warm, moist environment with weak light to ensure that the clones thrive.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Quarantine the clones for 3-5 days.:  If you got the cloned plants from an outside source, be sure to quarantine them before planting them. Place them in a separate room from the rest of your plants for 3-5 days. During this time, examine the plants for fungus or pests that could spread to your other plants.\\nTwisted, blistered, and wet-looking leaves are an indication of broad mites or russet mites.\\nSmall specks or bite marks on leaves are a sign of spider mites.\\nYellow spots on the leaves indicate a fungus called leaf septoria.\\nWhite spots, fuzzy patches, or powdery-looking leaves are signs of white powdery mildew.\\n', 'Dip infected clones in a foliar pest or fungal control product.:  Fortunately, both pests and fungi can be treated using the same method. Get a foliar pest or fungal control product from a garden shop or marijuana supply store. Pour the liquid into a container large enough that you can fit the clones in. Dip each clone in the solution, then let it dry completely before planting.\\nBe sure to wear gloves to avoid getting the product on your hands. If your skin does come into contact with the liquid, wash them with warm water and soap immediately.\\nYou also need to avoid contact with your eyes.\\n', 'Begin with new or clean pots with drainage holes.:  The pots should have drainage holes to keep the soil from becoming waterlogged. In order to avoid contamination, you should use new pots or sterilize used pots before planting clones in them. Spray or dip used pots in bleach or hydrogen peroxide to remove any leftover biological residue from previous plants. Let the pots dry completely before using them.\\nIt\u2019s best to transplant clones into small or medium-sized pots, rather than large ones, to ensure the nutrients in the soil aren\u2019t drained off and wasted during watering.\\n', 'Use new soil with high nitrogen levels and a pH of 6.:  Choose an organic soil with a diverse range of ingredients. Soil should contain high nitrogen levels for clones, as opposed to soil with high phosphorus levels for flowering plants. Ensure the pH of the soil you choose to use is right around 6 for best results.\\n\\nIt\u2019s important to purchase new soil, rather than reusing soil, to ensure that the clones aren\u2019t contaminated with pests or fungus from other plants.\\n', 'Plant clones when the roots are 3 inches (7.6\\xa0cm) long.:  Though some growers opt to plant their clones once the roots reach 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) long, it\u2019s best to wait until the roots are 3 inches (7.6\\xa0cm) or longer to reduce the chances of transplant shock.\\n', 'Fill a pot almost to the top with lightly-compacted soil.:  Leave at least 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) of space between the soil and the top of the pot to leave room for the water to settle before being absorbed. Use the bottom of another pot to lightly compact the soil, but don\u2019t compact it too much or the roots will have trouble spreading.\\n', 'Make a hole in the soil and gently place the clone into it.:  Don\u2019t force the cuttings into the soil or growing medium. Instead, use the end of a pencil to make a hole in the soil, then gently place the cutting inside of the hole. Use your fingertips to fill the hole and cover the roots with soil.\\nIf your clones are planted in rockwool, dig out a space in the pot large enough for the rockwool. Then, place the rockwool and clone inside the pot and cover the rockwool with soil.\\n', 'Water and mist the clones immediately after planting.:  Use only distilled water for marijuana plants, as the minerals, sodium, and chlorine in tap water can damage your plants. As soon as you\u2019ve gotten the clones in the pots, water the soil until it runs through the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. Then, use a mister or spray bottle to lightly mist the leaves and stem of each plant.\\n', 'Provide 18 hours of weak light per day.:  Strong, bright light is not necessary for clones. Use a weaker light, such as compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs, rather than high-intensity discharge (HID) light bulbs. Situate the bulbs 8 inches (20\\xa0cm) above the cloned plants. Set times on your lights so that the clones receive 18 hours of light and 6 hours of darkness in each 24-hour period.\\n', 'Ensure the temperature is between 72 and 77\\xa0\u00b0F (22 and 25\\xa0\u00b0C).:  Clones need a warm environment to thrive. They do best with temperatures between 72 and 77\\xa0\u00b0F (22 and 25\\xa0\u00b0C), so use a heater or cooling system in your grow room if necessary. Do your best to keep the temperature as consistent as possible, as fluctuations in temperature can weaken your plants.\\n', 'Keep the soil consistently moist.:  Check the soil each day to see if your plants need water. The soil should be moist, but not saturated. It\u2019s better to water the plants small amounts more frequently than large amounts less frequently. You can also use a mister or spray bottle to keep the leaves moist, as well.\\n', 'Provide little to no breeze for cloned plants.:  It\u2019s important to check your ventilation system before planting clones and adjust it as necessary. Because cloned plants are young and weak, too much of a breeze will dry out your clones. Ensure that there is little to no breeze in the space where the cloned plants are located.\\n', 'Treat the clones as adults after 6-8 weeks.:  After 6-8 weeks, the clones are considered adult marijuana plants. If the roots grow to the bottom of the pot, you can transplant them into larger pots. Provide the same amount of light, fertilizer, air circulation, and water as you would for other full-grown plants so they can mature and flower.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"plant clones when the roots are 3 inches (7.6 cm) long","question_type":"['navigation']","text_question":"What should I do after testing the soil?","question_id":"diy-232-9","intent_question":"request_next_step","intent_answer":"return_next_step"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-232","question":"I will be sure to give them the correct light, is there anything else I need to do?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Plant-Clones","data_split":"validation","original_answer":"Make sure the temperature is correct for the clones.","history":"student: What should I do after transplanting the clones? | teacher: Water and mist the clones immediately after planting.

Choose clean pots with new soil and provide a warm, moist environment with weak light to ensure that the clones thrive.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Quarantine the clones for 3-5 days.:  If you got the cloned plants from an outside source, be sure to quarantine them before planting them. Place them in a separate room from the rest of your plants for 3-5 days. During this time, examine the plants for fungus or pests that could spread to your other plants.\\nTwisted, blistered, and wet-looking leaves are an indication of broad mites or russet mites.\\nSmall specks or bite marks on leaves are a sign of spider mites.\\nYellow spots on the leaves indicate a fungus called leaf septoria.\\nWhite spots, fuzzy patches, or powdery-looking leaves are signs of white powdery mildew.\\n', 'Dip infected clones in a foliar pest or fungal control product.:  Fortunately, both pests and fungi can be treated using the same method. Get a foliar pest or fungal control product from a garden shop or marijuana supply store. Pour the liquid into a container large enough that you can fit the clones in. Dip each clone in the solution, then let it dry completely before planting.\\nBe sure to wear gloves to avoid getting the product on your hands. If your skin does come into contact with the liquid, wash them with warm water and soap immediately.\\nYou also need to avoid contact with your eyes.\\n', 'Begin with new or clean pots with drainage holes.:  The pots should have drainage holes to keep the soil from becoming waterlogged. In order to avoid contamination, you should use new pots or sterilize used pots before planting clones in them. Spray or dip used pots in bleach or hydrogen peroxide to remove any leftover biological residue from previous plants. Let the pots dry completely before using them.\\nIt\u2019s best to transplant clones into small or medium-sized pots, rather than large ones, to ensure the nutrients in the soil aren\u2019t drained off and wasted during watering.\\n', 'Use new soil with high nitrogen levels and a pH of 6.:  Choose an organic soil with a diverse range of ingredients. Soil should contain high nitrogen levels for clones, as opposed to soil with high phosphorus levels for flowering plants. Ensure the pH of the soil you choose to use is right around 6 for best results.\\n\\nIt\u2019s important to purchase new soil, rather than reusing soil, to ensure that the clones aren\u2019t contaminated with pests or fungus from other plants.\\n', 'Plant clones when the roots are 3 inches (7.6\\xa0cm) long.:  Though some growers opt to plant their clones once the roots reach 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) long, it\u2019s best to wait until the roots are 3 inches (7.6\\xa0cm) or longer to reduce the chances of transplant shock.\\n', 'Fill a pot almost to the top with lightly-compacted soil.:  Leave at least 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) of space between the soil and the top of the pot to leave room for the water to settle before being absorbed. Use the bottom of another pot to lightly compact the soil, but don\u2019t compact it too much or the roots will have trouble spreading.\\n', 'Make a hole in the soil and gently place the clone into it.:  Don\u2019t force the cuttings into the soil or growing medium. Instead, use the end of a pencil to make a hole in the soil, then gently place the cutting inside of the hole. Use your fingertips to fill the hole and cover the roots with soil.\\nIf your clones are planted in rockwool, dig out a space in the pot large enough for the rockwool. Then, place the rockwool and clone inside the pot and cover the rockwool with soil.\\n', 'Water and mist the clones immediately after planting.:  Use only distilled water for marijuana plants, as the minerals, sodium, and chlorine in tap water can damage your plants. As soon as you\u2019ve gotten the clones in the pots, water the soil until it runs through the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. Then, use a mister or spray bottle to lightly mist the leaves and stem of each plant.\\n', 'Provide 18 hours of weak light per day.:  Strong, bright light is not necessary for clones. Use a weaker light, such as compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs, rather than high-intensity discharge (HID) light bulbs. Situate the bulbs 8 inches (20\\xa0cm) above the cloned plants. Set times on your lights so that the clones receive 18 hours of light and 6 hours of darkness in each 24-hour period.\\n', 'Ensure the temperature is between 72 and 77\\xa0\u00b0F (22 and 25\\xa0\u00b0C).:  Clones need a warm environment to thrive. They do best with temperatures between 72 and 77\\xa0\u00b0F (22 and 25\\xa0\u00b0C), so use a heater or cooling system in your grow room if necessary. Do your best to keep the temperature as consistent as possible, as fluctuations in temperature can weaken your plants.\\n', 'Keep the soil consistently moist.:  Check the soil each day to see if your plants need water. The soil should be moist, but not saturated. It\u2019s better to water the plants small amounts more frequently than large amounts less frequently. You can also use a mister or spray bottle to keep the leaves moist, as well.\\n', 'Provide little to no breeze for cloned plants.:  It\u2019s important to check your ventilation system before planting clones and adjust it as necessary. Because cloned plants are young and weak, too much of a breeze will dry out your clones. Ensure that there is little to no breeze in the space where the cloned plants are located.\\n', 'Treat the clones as adults after 6-8 weeks.:  After 6-8 weeks, the clones are considered adult marijuana plants. If the roots grow to the bottom of the pot, you can transplant them into larger pots. Provide the same amount of light, fertilizer, air circulation, and water as you would for other full-grown plants so they can mature and flower.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"ensure the temperature is between 72 and 77 \u00b0f (22 and 25 \u00b0c)","question_type":"['history']","text_question":"I will be sure to give them the correct light, is there anything else I need to do?","question_id":"diy-232-10","intent_question":"request_next_step","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-233","question":"Where specifically do you recommend to go find the truffles?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Find-Truffles","data_split":"validation","original_answer":"You should look in Italy, France, Oregon, and Washington.","history":"student: Is this something that anyone can do or will it require traveling out of state? | teacher: That depends on where you're at.

Start by switching off the power to the disposal at your home\u2019s breaker box to ensure that you can work safely. Next, remove the old unit by detaching it from the mounting ring directly beneath the sink drain. Finally, install any necessary new mounting hardware, fit the new disposal into place, and turn on the water to test for leaks before giving it a trial run.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Turn off the power to the garbage disposal.:  Head to your home\u2019s main circuit breaker and find the switch corresponding to the garbage disposal unit. Flip the switch to the \u201cOff\u201d position. You\u2019ll now be able to work safely without worrying about accidentally receiving a nasty shock.\\nGarbage disposals are electrical appliances, which means there\u2019s a live current running through them at all time while the power is on.\\nMake sure that the water is cut off to your garbage disposal, too.\\n', 'Identify your garbage disposal.:  Open the doors beneath your sink and take a look directly under the drain. You should see a large cylindrical object situated between the bottom of the drain and the plumbing pipes. This is the actual garbage disposal unit that you\u2019ll be replacing.\\n\\nTake note of the make and model of the disposal. Replacing it with a similar model will be as easy as removing the existing unit and screwing on the new one.\\n', 'Disconnect the discharge tube.:  Locate the pipe extending from the side of the disposal into the ground plumbing. Loosen any nuts or fasteners at the pipe\u2019s connection site and give it a firm tug to pull it free.\\nThe discharge tube is responsible for carrying ground food waste out of the disposal.\\nSome older garbage disposals are also connected to the dishwasher water supply via a second tube. This one can be disconnected in the same manner.\\n', 'Release the old disposal from the mounting ring.:  At the top of the unit you should see a thin metal ring with 3 separate lugs, or protruding arms. Take hold of these lugs with one hand and twist the entire ring counterclockwise about 1.5 inches (3.8\\xa0cm) to dislodge the old unit. Set it aside on a sheet of newspaper or unfolded rag to keep from making a mess.\\nGarbage disposals tend to be surprisingly heavy (some can weigh as much as 15 pounds!), so be ready to catch and hold the unit once it comes away from the mounting ring.\\nIt may be a good idea to place a couple paint cans, some wood scraps, or a stack of phone books beneath the disposal to act as a support platform.\\n', 'Separate the disposal from the power supply.:  Turn the unit over and look for the round or square faceplate on the underside. This is the cover for the electrical housing. Unscrew the faceplate and slip the copper ground wire over the green screw. Then, pinch the plastic wire connectors to disconnect the colored wires from the main power supply.\\nA pair of needle-nosed pliers may come in handy for releasing wire connectors that are too small to unclip by hand.\\n', 'Pull off the existing mounting ring.:  Peel away the rubber snap ring on the bottom of the mounting ring that\u2019s holding it in place. The mounting ring itself should then simply slide off.\\nIf there\u2019s a separate gasket sandwiched above the mounting ring, be sure to remove it as well.\\nConsider keeping your current mounting hardware if it looks to be in good shape. This will make installing the new disposal much quicker and easier.\\n', \"Loosen the nut securing the rest of the assembly.:  Just below the sink flange where the drain empties into the garbage disposal you\u2019ll see a circular plastic piece similar in appearance to the mounting ring. Insert the tip of a screwdriver into one of the lugs on this piece and rotate it in a counterclockwise direction. Pull the nut away and set it aside.\\nYou may have to apply a considerable amount of force to undo a mounting nut that\u2019s had years to settle into place. If you're having trouble getting it to budge, try pushing the handle of the screwdriver with both hands rather than pulling. You'll get better leverage this way.\\n\", 'Remove the sink flange.:  The flange is the rounded metal rim that circles the drain opening. Wiggle or push on the bottom of the flange from underneath, then stand up and lift it out from the top. The old flange can also go into your pile of parts destined for disposal.\\nIf you see any dry, crusted remnants of plumber\u2019s putty where the flange sat, use a putty knife to scrape it off.\\nPat the drain opening dry with a clean towel before attempting to use adhesive to secure the new flange.\\n', \"Install the new sink flange.:  Apply a ring of fresh plumber\u2019s putty around the edges of the underside of the flange (the surface that will rest against the sink basin).

I've included a more detailed approach to this step below.","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Replace a Garbage Disposal', 'description': '\\nNo need to worry if your garbage disposal is on the fritz\u2014installing a new one is a straightforward project that you can do yourself in just a few minutes. Start by switching off the power to the disposal at your home\u2019s breaker box to ensure that you can work safely. Next, remove the old unit by detaching it from the mounting ring directly beneath the sink drain. Finally, install any necessary new mounting hardware, fit the new disposal into place, and turn on the water to test for leaks before giving it a trial run.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Turn off the power to the garbage disposal.:  Head to your home\u2019s main circuit breaker and find the switch corresponding to the garbage disposal unit. Flip the switch to the \u201cOff\u201d position. You\u2019ll now be able to work safely without worrying about accidentally receiving a nasty shock.\\nGarbage disposals are electrical appliances, which means there\u2019s a live current running through them at all time while the power is on.\\nMake sure that the water is cut off to your garbage disposal, too.\\n', 'Identify your garbage disposal.:  Open the doors beneath your sink and take a look directly under the drain. You should see a large cylindrical object situated between the bottom of the drain and the plumbing pipes. This is the actual garbage disposal unit that you\u2019ll be replacing.\\n\\nTake note of the make and model of the disposal. Replacing it with a similar model will be as easy as removing the existing unit and screwing on the new one.\\n', 'Disconnect the discharge tube.:  Locate the pipe extending from the side of the disposal into the ground plumbing. Loosen any nuts or fasteners at the pipe\u2019s connection site and give it a firm tug to pull it free.\\nThe discharge tube is responsible for carrying ground food waste out of the disposal.\\nSome older garbage disposals are also connected to the dishwasher water supply via a second tube. This one can be disconnected in the same manner.\\n', 'Release the old disposal from the mounting ring.:  At the top of the unit you should see a thin metal ring with 3 separate lugs, or protruding arms. Take hold of these lugs with one hand and twist the entire ring counterclockwise about 1.5 inches (3.8\\xa0cm) to dislodge the old unit. Set it aside on a sheet of newspaper or unfolded rag to keep from making a mess.\\nGarbage disposals tend to be surprisingly heavy (some can weigh as much as 15 pounds!), so be ready to catch and hold the unit once it comes away from the mounting ring.\\nIt may be a good idea to place a couple paint cans, some wood scraps, or a stack of phone books beneath the disposal to act as a support platform.\\n', 'Separate the disposal from the power supply.:  Turn the unit over and look for the round or square faceplate on the underside. This is the cover for the electrical housing. Unscrew the faceplate and slip the copper ground wire over the green screw. Then, pinch the plastic wire connectors to disconnect the colored wires from the main power supply.\\nA pair of needle-nosed pliers may come in handy for releasing wire connectors that are too small to unclip by hand.\\n', 'Pull off the existing mounting ring.:  Peel away the rubber snap ring on the bottom of the mounting ring that\u2019s holding it in place. The mounting ring itself should then simply slide off.\\nIf there\u2019s a separate gasket sandwiched above the mounting ring, be sure to remove it as well.\\nConsider keeping your current mounting hardware if it looks to be in good shape. This will make installing the new disposal much quicker and easier.\\n', \"Loosen the nut securing the rest of the assembly.:  Just below the sink flange where the drain empties into the garbage disposal you\u2019ll see a circular plastic piece similar in appearance to the mounting ring. Insert the tip of a screwdriver into one of the lugs on this piece and rotate it in a counterclockwise direction. Pull the nut away and set it aside.\\nYou may have to apply a considerable amount of force to undo a mounting nut that\u2019s had years to settle into place. If you're having trouble getting it to budge, try pushing the handle of the screwdriver with both hands rather than pulling. You'll get better leverage this way.\\n\", 'Remove the sink flange.:  The flange is the rounded metal rim that circles the drain opening. Wiggle or push on the bottom of the flange from underneath, then stand up and lift it out from the top. The old flange can also go into your pile of parts destined for disposal.\\nIf you see any dry, crusted remnants of plumber\u2019s putty where the flange sat, use a putty knife to scrape it off.\\nPat the drain opening dry with a clean towel before attempting to use adhesive to secure the new flange.\\n', \"Install the new sink flange.:  Apply a ring of fresh plumber\u2019s putty around the edges of the underside of the flange (the surface that will rest against the sink basin). Fit the slender end into the drain opening and press the flange firmly into position. Hold it for 30 seconds to a minute while the putty begins to set up.\\nUse a heavy object, such as a toolbox or the old garbage disposal unit, to keep constant pressure on the new flange until the adhesive has had time to fully dry. This may take anywhere from 10-20 minutes, depending on the specific product you're using.\\nThe added weight will also prevent the flange from shifting as you install the new unit.\\nYou also have the option of using silicone sealant in place of traditional plumber\u2019s putty. Many home improvement experts claim that silicone has a stronger hold and provides a longer-lasting watertight seal.\\n\", 'Connect the new mounting assembly.:  Working in reverse order now, slide a rubber gasket over the bottom of the new sink flange, followed by a second metal flange.
