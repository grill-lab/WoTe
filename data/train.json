Commercial fertilizer can be expensive and full of harmful chemicals that are toxic for the soil. You can fertilize your garden cheaply, and naturally, by using food products and plants. You can also use animal products as natural, cheap fertilizer.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Use coffee grounds as fertilizer.:  Used coffee grounds contain good nutrients for plants like nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. They are particularly good for blueberries, evergreens, azaleas, roses, and fruit trees. Use your own coffee grounds or ask coffee shops for their used grounds.\\nLet the used coffee grounds dry and then scatter them like mulch over your plants. Do not use wet ones, as they will mold.\\n', 'Fertilize the garden with bananas.:  Bananas are great for providing potassium for the plants, especially roses. Bury a whole banana, or just the peel, in the top layer of soil next to rose bushes and other plants.\\nOver time, replace the bananas with fresh ones.\\n', 'Add egg shells to the garden.:  Egg shells contain beneficial nutrients for plants like nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and calcium. Crush up egg shells in an old coffee grinder and sprinkle them on your garden soil for a natural fertilizer.\\nGet in the habit of adding fresh ground egg shells to your soil once a week. Plant roots need a steady supply of calcium, which can be found in egg shells, to thrive.\\n', 'Fertilize the garden with Blackstrap molasses.:  Blackstrap molasses contains carbon, iron, sulfur, potash, calcium, manganese, magnesium, and potassium, which are all great for plants. Mix Blackstrap molasses with 1 cup (236 ml) epsom salts and 1 cup (236 ml) alfalfa meal. Dissolve the mixture in 4 gallons (15 L) of water and then spread it on your garden.\\nMolasses also feeds beneficial bacteria in the soil, which will keep your plants healthy and happy.\\n', 'Soak the garden with epsom salts.:  Epsom salts are great for encouraging plant growth and seed germination. Combine 1 tablespoon (14 ml) of Epsom salts with 1 gallon (3.7L) of water. Put the mixture in a spray bottle and apply it to the foliage in the garden.\\nThe Epsom salts can also increase fruit and flower production for roses, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, and indoor houseplants.\\n', 'Use grass clippings.:  Grass clippings make great organic fertilizer as they provide moisture for the soil and prevent weeds from cropping up. Use freshly cut grass from lawns that have not been treated with herbicides. Sprinkle a \u00bd inch (1.27 cm) layer of grass clippings on the soil as fertilizer.\\nDepending on how much grass you have, you may be able to cut grass clippings for your garden every one to two weeks.\\n', 'Make green manure with plants.:  Green manure is a good, natural fertilizer for your garden. Combine wheat, oats, rye, clover, peas, vetch, buckwheat, and broad beans. Then, spread the manure over the soil in your garden. Do this once a season.\\nYou can buy the ingredients for green manure at your local gardening store or online.\\n', 'Use wood ash or sawdust as fertilizer.:  Wood ash and sawdust add calcium and potassium to the soil. They can also help to raise the pH of the soil if it is too acidic, making it more hospitable to neutral pH plants like vegetables. Sprinkle wood ash or sawdust to the soil. Use five pounds (2.5 kg) of wood ash or sawdust for every 100 square feet (9 square metres) of soil.\\nYou can get wood ash from the bottom of your fireplace or your fire pit.\\nYou can get sawdust from your local woodshop.\\n', 'Fertilize the garden with aged animal manure.:  Manure is a great natural fertilizer for the garden. Use manure from cows, horses, pigs, and dogs. Make sure you age it for six months, as fresh manure is too overpowering for plants. Spread aged manure in a \u00bc to \u00bd inch (0.6-1.27 cm) layer over your garden soil. You can also till it or mix it in by hand.\\nYou can buy aged manure at your local gardening center.\\nPut animal manure in the garden in the fall or winter, before you do any spring planting.\\n', 'Use fish guts and bones to make fish fertilizer.:  Fish guts, bones, and heads are a great source of plant nutrients like nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous acid, and amino acids. You can use fresh guts, bones, and heads from fish like tuna or salmon. Or, freeze fish parts during the year so you can make fish fertilizer in the spring.\\nCollect fish parts from your own cooking or buy fish parts from your local fish merchant.\\nCombine 1 part fish with 2 parts water in an airtight container. Place it in a sunny spot far from your home to avoid the smell. Stir the mixture every two days for about two weeks. Then, apply the fish fertilizer to your garden.\\nYou can also take the aquarium water from your tank and use it to fertilize the garden. Only use fresh water from a fresh water tank, not salt water.\\nFish fertilizer is particularly good for leafy greens, beets, Brussel sprouts, and broccoli.\\n', 'Fertilize with worm castings.:  Worm castings contain beneficial nutrients for the soil. You can buy worm castings from your local gardening store or start a \\nAdd enough worm castings to cover the soil completely in a thin layer.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"crush up egg shells in an old coffee grinder and sprinkle them on your garden soil for a natural fertilizer","question_type":"['confirmation', 'complex']","text_question":"I don't have a coffee grinder.

I've share the details here.","history":"student: Are mattress sizes all standard?  | teacher: Most mattress stores will carry most standard sizes of mattresses. Check your bed frame if you don't know the dimensions. After you got your size we want to think about what to look for in a mattress. I've shared some details for foam mattresses here. | student: What is memory foam made out of? | teacher: Memory foam can be made from many things and the individual components will change depending on density, firmness and cooling properties. Next I want to go over some details on density. I've shared them here.","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Buy a Memory Foam Mattress', 'description': '\\nMemory foam mattresses are well known for their extreme comfort. The material molds to your body, making it feel like you\u2019re sleeping on a cloud. These mattresses can provide a comfortable night\u2019s sleep to a wide variety of consumers looking for both firm and soft beds. Before you make your purchase, you\u2019ll want to understand some of the different options and characteristics of memory foam mattresses.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Pick high-density foam for firmness and durability.:  Each memory foam mattress lists its density in the product information. High-density foam is defined as above 5 (2.27 kg) and especially 6 lbs. (2.72 kg). This mattress will feel quite firm at first, but it will adapt to your body to relieve pain and pressure points. Lasting about 8-10 years, it\u2019s the best choice for those looking for durability, although it will cost more.\\n', 'Choose medium-density foam for a compromise.:  Mid-grade foam is defined as 4 to 5 lbs (1.81-2.27 kg). This option should also provide you with a durability of about 8-10 years, and it may be more comfortable and less costly than high-density foam.\\n', 'Go with low-density foam for softness and a lower cost.:  Low-density foam, normally 2 to 3 lb. (0.91-1.36 kg), will likely feel more comfortable when you lie down, as you\u2019ll sink into the layer. While this foam is less expensive than higher density options, it\u2019s also less durable. You may have to replace it within 4-6 years.\\n', 'Check the ILD rating of each layer in the mattress.:  The ILD is another important indicator of firmness. Low ILDs will give you a soft and comfortable surface, while highers ILDs create resistance and support for your back. You generally want lower ILDs (10-11) for the top layers and at least one layer with a higher ILD (20-40) to prevent low-back pain.\\n', 'Look for memory foam mattresses with cooling layers.:  Memory foam is a temperature-sensitive material that softens as it comes in contact with your body heat. This is what gives it the ability to contour to your body, but the foam can also get overly hot at night. Many memory foam mattresses now offer top layers made with different materials to increase ventilation and keep you cool.\\n', 'Choose gel memory foam for a cool surface and good support.:  Gel memory foam increases the air circulation in memory foam, providing a cooler surface. This option also offers increased and more balanced support for your back. This may help relieve chronic back pain.\\nBe aware that the gel memory foam will be cool at first, but it will heat up to match your body temperature over the course of the night. Gel layers may only help you fall asleep.\\n', 'Pick natural latex foam to avoid the drawbacks of memory foam.:  Natural latex foam maintains the same general softness and support as memory foam, but does not have its temperature sensitivity. This will likely prevent you from experiencing the cloud-like feeling that comes from memory foam. However, natural latex will not cause you to \u201csleep hot,\u201d and it won\u2019t give off any chemical odors.\\n', 'Avoid harmful chemicals by checking for CertiPUR-US certifications.:  CertiPUR-US is an American-based non-for-profit program that prevents foam from including harmful metals, chemicals, ozone depleters, or dangerous gas emissions. Most mattress companies will advertise that their products have received this certification.\\nWhile companies from all over the world can be CertiPUR-US-certified, the certification adheres to American standards. These standards are comparable with the European-based Eco-label.\\n', 'Choose a bamboo cover for hypoallergenic protection.:  The density of latex and memory foam mattresses already inhibits the spread of allergy-causing dust mites. The bamboo cover will supplement this resistance, as bamboo is naturally dust and mildew resistant.\\n\\n', 'Read online reviews to gauge quality and pricing.:  Before you decide on a product, check out previous buyers\u2019 experiences to avoid falling into a consumer trap. Reviews will provide you with information about the relationship between the cost and the overall comfort and quality of the mattress.\\n\\n', 'Visit a local mattress store.:  Even if you plan to make your final purchase online, it\u2019s extremely important that you lie down at least once on the mattress you intend to buy. Mattress stores will allow you to test their beds by hopping on and getting comfortable, so take advantage.\\n', 'Spend at least twenty minutes with each option.:  Give yourself ample time to fully experience the mattress. Try moving around and lying in various positions. Many memory foam mattresses are made specifically to suit back, side, or stomach sleepers, and it\u2019s important that you test these labels. Some beds will also inhibit your movement, and you\u2019ll want to know this before you buy.\\n', \"Read the warranty information carefully.:  Learn exactly what will be required of you when you have a warranty issue. What counts as an issue covered by the warranty? Will you be responsible for packaging and shipping the mattress? Most importantly, how long has the manufacturer been in business? A lifetime warranty from a company that's only been in business for a short while is probably worthless.\\n\\nMost warranties will cover problems with the mattress that appear to be manufacturer related. Warranties will rarely cover damage caused by you or by normal wear and tear.\\n\", 'Ask your salesperson for a trial period.:  You should be able to test out your memory foam mattress to see if you have any issues or don\u2019t like the feel of the material. These trials generally last between two weeks and a month. Be sure you understand the return policy in case you end up not liking the mattress.\\nThe company will likely require the mattress to be in as-new condition at the end of the trial period if you choose to return the product. Any damage to the mattress will almost certainly prevent you from making a return.\\n', 'Negotiate the price if you\u2019re in a small store.:  If you\u2019re in a local store, you may be facing overpriced products. Talk to your salesperson to negotiate these prices down to match the minimum prices you can find for the product online. Larger chains should already match these minimum prices.\\nIf you face resistance in this conversation, try telling your salesperson that you\u2019ve found the same product for a better price elsewhere. While they may tell you that you\u2019re welcome to make your purchase where you\u2019d like, they might also take the opportunity to prevent you from walking out the door.\\n', 'Search for coupons.:  Both stores and online vendors should have coupon options available. Search online for printable coupons to take in the store with you, or apply promotional codes at the end of your online purchase. You can also search your town\u2019s weekly advertising circular for local couponing options.\\n\\nThere are a variety of online options for finding coupons. Honey is an internet add-on that will automatically search for and apply coupons to your online purchases, or you can use RetailMeNot.com to look up specific stores.\\n', 'Purchase in a store to receive more reliable customer service.:  Buying your mattress in a store means that you have a physical location and specific person to visit if you have problems with your product.\\nWhen you buy in a store, you\u2019re usually guaranteed assistance in moving and setting up the mattress.\\n', 'Buy online for reduced prices and convenient purchasing.:  Online purchasing will allow you to avoid haggling with a salesperson over prices. However, be aware that your purchase may not meet your expectations, especially if you didn\u2019t visit a store to test it out. It may also be more difficult for you to return a mattress purchased online.\\n\\nNote that online vendors may only ship \u201ccompressed,\u201d or rolled-up, memory foam mattresses that need about a day to fully decompress before you can sleep on them.\\n', 'File the receipt, warranty, and trial paperwork.:  Whether you make your purchase online or in the store, set aside a specific place on your computer or in your house for your purchasing records. You should be sure that the receipt, warranty paperwork, and any trial period agreements are somewhere that you can easily access and won\u2019t forget about.\\n\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"durability","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"What are the benefits of high-density foam?","question_id":"diy-10-7","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"ask_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-12","question":"Sorry, I'm a total plant novice.

Sweet pea pods and seeds are not edible, but you can harvest them from the plant to propagate more flowers. Sweet pea flowers come in many colors, making them a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. To plant more sweet peas, you can harvest and dry the pods and collect the seeds for planting the following year.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Stop picking the flowers to encourage seed production.:  Picking flowers from a plant encourages more flower production. But to harvest seeds, you need the sweet pea to stop producing flowers and focus its energy on producing pods instead. When the weather becomes hotter and drier later in the summer, stop picking the sweet pea flowers.\\n', \"Let the plant go to seed.:  When you stop harvesting flowers and pruning the sweet peas, they will go to seed. When this happens, the flowers will die off and the sweet peas will start to form pods that are full of seeds. Then, you'll have to wait for the pods to develop and brown before you can pick them.\\n\", 'Watch for the pods to go brown.:  As the pods develop, they will swell as the seeds form inside of them. Leave the pods and the plants alone, and over the course of a couple of weeks, the pods will turn from a light green to a yellowish green to a paper-bag brown.\\n', \"Pick the pods when they're paper bag brown.:  When the pods change from yellowish green to brown, trim the pods from the flowers using gardening sheers. Trim the pods so there some stem left on them, as this will make them easier to dry.\\nHarvest the pods before the weather turns wet and rainy, because the water can cause the seeds to germinate. You don\u2019t want that if you're looking to save the seeds to plant next year.\\n\", 'Hang the pods to dry.:  When you\u2019ve collected the pods, group them into bunches of five to 10. Tie the bunches together by wrapping string or elastic around the stems. Hang the bunches from a clothesline or door handle in a cool, dry place. Use hooks, string, or clothespins to fasten the bunches to the clothesline or handle.\\n\\nLeave the pods to dry for several days to a week, until the pods start splitting open.\\nA good place to dry the pods is a garage or dry basement.\\n', \"Break open the splitting pods.:  When the pods have had a few days to dry and are starting to split open, remove them from where they're hanging. Unwrap the elastics holding the bunches together, and lay the pods on a clean cloth. Use your nail or a knife to pry the pods open at the seams.\\n\", 'Remove the seeds from the pods.:  Once the pods have been broken open, pick out the seeds with your fingers or a spoon. Transfer the seeds to another clean towel.\\n', 'Dry the seeds for another day or two if necessary.:  Leave the seeds on the towel to dry for another few days in the same cool, dry place where you dried the pods.\\n', \"Store the seeds in a cool, dry place.:  When the seeds are fully dry and are no longer plump or contain moisture, transfer them to an envelope or paper bag for storage. Close the flap and label the envelope with the type of seeds and the date. Store the seeds somewhere cool and dark until you're ready to plant them in the spring.\\nWhen dried and stored properly, sweet pea seeds will last between one and three years.\\n\", 'Plant the seeds in late winter or early spring.:  Sweet peas will do best if they get an early start. As soon as the soil can be worked in the late winter or early spring, get ready to plant the seeds. In climates with mild winters where the ground doesn\u2019t freeze, you can actually plant the seeds in October or November to have early spring flowers.\\n', 'Select a sunny site with cool soil.:  Sweet peas like full sun, but they also need to have their roots kept cool. An ideal place for sweet peas is an area that gets full sun, but that has low-growing plants nearby to keep the roots shaded.\\n', 'Amend the soil.:  The best type of soil for sweet peas is a well-draining soil that\u2019s slightly alkaline. Till the garden bed with aged manure or compost before planting. Till the soil to a depth of 2 feet (61 cm). To make the soil more alkaline, sprinkle lime powder over the tilled garden bed.\\n', 'Soak and nick the seeds.:  The day before you want to plant, soak the seeds in a cup of warm water for 24 hours. Before planting, drain the water and collect the seeds. Use a pair of nail clippers to make a small nick in each seed right before planting.

","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Harvest Sweet Pea Seed Pods', 'description': '\\nThe sweet pea is a flowering plant that\u2019s native to parts of the Mediterranean, but people grow it all over the world for the sweet-smelling and beautiful flowers. Sweet pea pods and seeds are not edible, but you can harvest them from the plant to propagate more flowers. Sweet pea flowers come in many colors, making them a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. To plant more sweet peas, you can harvest and dry the pods and collect the seeds for planting the following year.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Stop picking the flowers to encourage seed production.:  Picking flowers from a plant encourages more flower production. But to harvest seeds, you need the sweet pea to stop producing flowers and focus its energy on producing pods instead. When the weather becomes hotter and drier later in the summer, stop picking the sweet pea flowers.\\n', \"Let the plant go to seed.:  When you stop harvesting flowers and pruning the sweet peas, they will go to seed. When this happens, the flowers will die off and the sweet peas will start to form pods that are full of seeds. Then, you'll have to wait for the pods to develop and brown before you can pick them.\\n\", 'Watch for the pods to go brown.:  As the pods develop, they will swell as the seeds form inside of them. Leave the pods and the plants alone, and over the course of a couple of weeks, the pods will turn from a light green to a yellowish green to a paper-bag brown.\\n', \"Pick the pods when they're paper bag brown.:  When the pods change from yellowish green to brown, trim the pods from the flowers using gardening sheers. Trim the pods so there some stem left on them, as this will make them easier to dry.\\nHarvest the pods before the weather turns wet and rainy, because the water can cause the seeds to germinate. You don\u2019t want that if you're looking to save the seeds to plant next year.\\n\", 'Hang the pods to dry.:  When you\u2019ve collected the pods, group them into bunches of five to 10. Tie the bunches together by wrapping string or elastic around the stems. Hang the bunches from a clothesline or door handle in a cool, dry place. Use hooks, string, or clothespins to fasten the bunches to the clothesline or handle.\\n\\nLeave the pods to dry for several days to a week, until the pods start splitting open.\\nA good place to dry the pods is a garage or dry basement.\\n', \"Break open the splitting pods.:  When the pods have had a few days to dry and are starting to split open, remove them from where they're hanging. Unwrap the elastics holding the bunches together, and lay the pods on a clean cloth. Use your nail or a knife to pry the pods open at the seams.\\n\", 'Remove the seeds from the pods.:  Once the pods have been broken open, pick out the seeds with your fingers or a spoon. Transfer the seeds to another clean towel.\\n', 'Dry the seeds for another day or two if necessary.:  Leave the seeds on the towel to dry for another few days in the same cool, dry place where you dried the pods.\\n', \"Store the seeds in a cool, dry place.:  When the seeds are fully dry and are no longer plump or contain moisture, transfer them to an envelope or paper bag for storage. Close the flap and label the envelope with the type of seeds and the date. Store the seeds somewhere cool and dark until you're ready to plant them in the spring.\\nWhen dried and stored properly, sweet pea seeds will last between one and three years.\\n\", 'Plant the seeds in late winter or early spring.:  Sweet peas will do best if they get an early start. As soon as the soil can be worked in the late winter or early spring, get ready to plant the seeds. In climates with mild winters where the ground doesn\u2019t freeze, you can actually plant the seeds in October or November to have early spring flowers.\\n', 'Select a sunny site with cool soil.:  Sweet peas like full sun, but they also need to have their roots kept cool. An ideal place for sweet peas is an area that gets full sun, but that has low-growing plants nearby to keep the roots shaded.\\n', 'Amend the soil.:  The best type of soil for sweet peas is a well-draining soil that\u2019s slightly alkaline. Till the garden bed with aged manure or compost before planting. Till the soil to a depth of 2 feet (61 cm). To make the soil more alkaline, sprinkle lime powder over the tilled garden bed.\\n', 'Soak and nick the seeds.:  The day before you want to plant, soak the seeds in a cup of warm water for 24 hours. Before planting, drain the water and collect the seeds. Use a pair of nail clippers to make a small nick in each seed right before planting. This will speed up the germination process and increase the chances of success when you plant.\\n', 'Plant the seeds.:  Dig a long row in the garden where you want to plant the sweet peas. The trench should be about 4 inches (10 cm) deep. Use the sharpened end of a pencil to poke holes in the soil inside the trench, and then drop a single seed into each hole. Cover the holes with a bit of soil and press down to encase the seeds with soil.\\n', \"Water the plants regularly as they grow.:  Sweet peas need moist soil, so be sure to give them plenty of water if you aren't getting much rain.

It also has slightly different requirements for planting and growing. With a little knowledge, you can plant, grow, and care for popcorn. In no time, you'll have a harvest of popcorn that you can cook and enjoy.\\n\\n\", 'steps': [\"Buy some fertile popcorn seeds.:  You can use plain popcorn from a bag, but you will want to do a fertility test first. Not all store-bought popcorn will be fertile because of the heating and sterilization processes popcorn goes through before being packaged and sold. You can also buy popcorn seeds from a seed company or from a farmer.\\nTo test store-bought popcorn for fertility: sow 20 seeds, water, and wait. If the corn grows in about a week, you have fertile seeds. If 2 weeks pass, and you still don't see any sprouts emerging, you have infertile seeds. The seeds must be fertile in order to grow.\\n\", 'Soak the corn kernels in warm water for 12 hours.:  This helps moisten them so they will germinate faster.\\n', \"Choose the right spot.:  Make sure that the spot will receive lots of sunlight and that the soil drains easily. You will need lots of room to grow corn.\\n\\nDon't plant within 100 feet (30.48 meters) of other types of corn, or you may get cross pollination. This could result in hybrids, and may affect the flavor.\\n\", 'Plant the kernels after the danger of frost has passed.:  Depending on where you live, this will be sometime between the first week in March and the middle of May.\\nSpace seeds 8 to 10 inches (20.32 to 25.4 centimeters) apart.

Irises are among the easiest perennials to start and grow, so start planting today for long-lasting blooms.\\n\\n\", 'steps': ['Choose a suitable species of iris.:  Though nearly all irises are fairly hardy and easy to maintain, some are more suitable for certain conditions than others. Depending on the climate and conditions where you plan on planting your irises, one variety may be a better choice. Below is information on just a few of the most common iris varieties:\\nSiberian Iris: Despite its name, native to Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey. One of the most adaptable irises \u2014 very easy to grow and maintain. Do especially well in temperate climates.\\nLouisiana Iris: Native to the hot, humid southeastern United States. In spite of this, grows well in a wide variety of conditions. However, they will not bloom well if they receive less than an inch of water or so during hot growing season months.\\nBeardless Iris: Native to Central and Southern Europe. Do well with at least half a day of full sun. Can even survive constant sun though this is not necessarily preferable.\\n', \"Plant in late summer.:  Most Irises are best planted in late summer (early fall at the latest). This gives the iris a chance to establish its roots while there is still enough sunlight to fuel its growth so that it can survive the winter. For most Iris varieties, July and August are the best months for planting.\\nNote, however, that in areas with long summers and mild winters, you can get away with planting irises as late as September or even October \u2014 in these cases, there's usually still enough sunlight to help the plant grow its roots before winter.\\n\", \"Pick a spot with about six to eight hours of full sun per day.:  Most irises thrive if given generous amounts of sunlight. You won't necessarily want your iris to be in constant sun (though they can still do well in these situations), but they can usually stand more sun than similarly-sized flowers. Try planting your irises in a flowerbed that receives the shade of a tree late in the day or on the side of your house that the sun hits in the afternoon for a good amount of light.\\n\\n\", 'Plant in slightly acidic soil with good drainage.:  Irises prefer soils that are neutral to slightly acidic \u2014 a pH of about 6.8-7.0 is best. In addition, irises require soil with a good amount of aeration and drainage.\\nFor heavy, clay-rich soils with bad drainage, try adding humus or organic matter to improve the permeability of the soil.\\nPlanting on a slope or in a raised flower bed can help with drainage \u2014 in these cases, water will naturally run away from the iris.\\n', \"Plant the rhizome so that its top is exposed.:  One common mistake first-timers make when planting irises is to plant them too deep. Unlike most plants, irises do best when their rhizome \u2014 the brown, root-like structure at their base resembling a potato \u2014 is slightly exposed to the air. The plant's roots should be arranged so that they spread downward beneath the rhizome.\\n\\nNote that in very hot climates, covering the rhizomes with a thin layer of dirt (no more than an inch or so) can help protect them from drying out.\\n\", 'Plant the rhizomes so that they are spaced apart.:  More so than other flowers, irises have a tendency to grow together when they\\'re planted near one another. When this happens, the plants can compete for the same soil, water and nutrients, hampering each others\\' growth. To prevent this, try to plant your irises\\' rhizomes at least one to two feet apart.\\nEven with this preventative measure, after a few years, your irises may grow together anyway. If this happens, don\\'t worry \u2014 you can fix this by simply digging up some of the rhizomes and replanting them farther away to \"thin out\" your flowers.\\n', \"If the growing conditions are unfavorable, pot the iris.:  Depending on where you live and what time of the year it is, conditions outdoors may not be suitable for growing new plants. Rather than plant your irises in the soil outside when they're not likely to do well, instead, get them started in a pot. This allows you to carefully control the amount of time that the plants are exposed to the weather outside until it improves and you can transfer them to the garden. If conditions are very bad, like, for instance, if there's heavy frost, you can even keep the plants indoors 24\/7.\\n\\nFor most irises, a 12-inch pot will work well. Exceptionally small irises can do well in 6-to-8-inch pots.\\nRegardless of the size of pot you use, make sure it has good drainage \u2014 at least one big hole on the bottom (or several smaller ones) for the water to drain out of.\\n\", 'Water generously after planting.:  After you plant your irises, give them a thorough watering. If conditions are dry, water every 7 to 10 days or as needed during the morning or evening.\\nOne common mistake to avoid with your irises is over-watering. If the rhizome or roots are held in contact with moisture without being given a chance to drain, root rot can set in. This fungal condition can be potentially fatal for the iris and easily spreads to nearby plants, so prevention is key.\\n', \"Taper watering off as the plant becomes established.:  Over time, your plant will require less and less watering on your part. Once the weather takes a turn for the cooler in the fall, you can stop watering until the next summer growing season. In general, your iris should require less watering with each subsequent summer \u2014 for climates with mild summers, it's possible\\n\\nThe exception here is for areas with very hot, dry summers. In these cases, some watering may be necessary every summer to keep the iris from drying out. Though irises are quite durable, they can't survive in extreme conditions without help.\\n\", \"Keep rhizomes uncovered and roots well-aerated.:  As the iris grows, you'll want to periodically check to make sure that the rhizome hasn't become covered with dirt, organic matter, or other debris. If it has, gently brush it off without moving the plant itself or disturbing its roots. In addition, make sure that the soil still has good aeration and drainage \u2014 if it doesn't, add humus or organic matter as needed.\\n\\n\", \"Trim brown or dying leaf matter and the flower stalk.:  Unlike high-maintenance garden plants, iris leaves don't require pruning or trimming for good growth. In fact, leaving the leaves undisturbed even after the growing season allows the iris to gain more nutrients from photosynthesis for next year's growth.\\nNote that, before winter, you may also want to cut the flower stalk to its base. If the flower dies during winter and falls at the base of the plant, it can cause rot to spread to the rhizome as it decays.\\n\", \"Protect the plants in preparation for winter.:  As the plant's roots establish themselves throughout the late summer and early fall, you may want to put some thought to how you plan to protect your irises once the weather grows cold, especially if you live in an area with exceptionally cold winters. Snowfall can naturally protect the soil from the cracking and heaving that can occur during very cold weather and dislodge the rhizomes.\\nIf your area doesn't reliably get snowfall, you may want to spread a loose mulch (like evergreen bough) across the ground to protect the soil. Don't apply a thick layer of mulch \u2014 this can actually trap moisture in the soil and cause rot.\\nDestroy any irises exposed to heavy frost \u2014 left to rot, these plants can become havens for borer eggs.\\n\", \"Weed and protect against pests in the spring.:  As the weather begins to warm, you can allow any snow to melt naturally and\/or remove any protective mulches you used in the winter. As new plants begin to sprout up, keep a keen eye out for any weeds near your irises and pull them out as early as possible. Use environmentally-friendly herbicides or weed killers to keep grasses and weed away from the bases of your irises.\\n\\nIn addition, you'll want to be wary of any encroaching pests, especially slugs. There are many, many ways to bait slugs, from commercial products to improvised home solutions. One very easy way to do this is to make a beer trap \u2014 fill a wide-mouthed jar halfway up with beer and bury it up to the rim of the jar in the soil. Slugs, attracted to the beer, will fall in and drown.\\n\", 'Monitor growth and give nutrients in the spring.:  Irises can benefit from the occasional light application of fertilizer starting the growing season after you plant it. Don\\'t use a fertilizer high in nitrogen \u2014 this can cause excessive foliage growth (and, eventually, rot). Water after dispensing the fertilizer to avoid fertilizer \"burn\".

One of the most adaptable irises \u2014 very easy to grow and maintain. Do especially well in temperate climates.\\nLouisiana Iris: Native to the hot, humid southeastern United States. In spite of this, grows well in a wide variety of conditions. However, they will not bloom well if they receive less than an inch of water or so during hot growing season months.\\nBeardless Iris: Native to Central and Southern Europe. Do well with at least half a day of full sun. Can even survive constant sun though this is not necessarily preferable.\\n', \"Plant in late summer.:  Most Irises are best planted in late summer (early fall at the latest). This gives the iris a chance to establish its roots while there is still enough sunlight to fuel its growth so that it can survive the winter. For most Iris varieties, July and August are the best months for planting.\\nNote, however, that in areas with long summers and mild winters, you can get away with planting irises as late as September or even October \u2014 in these cases, there's usually still enough sunlight to help the plant grow its roots before winter.\\n\", \"Pick a spot with about six to eight hours of full sun per day.:  Most irises thrive if given generous amounts of sunlight. You won't necessarily want your iris to be in constant sun (though they can still do well in these situations), but they can usually stand more sun than similarly-sized flowers. Try planting your irises in a flowerbed that receives the shade of a tree late in the day or on the side of your house that the sun hits in the afternoon for a good amount of light.\\n\\n\", 'Plant in slightly acidic soil with good drainage.:  Irises prefer soils that are neutral to slightly acidic \u2014 a pH of about 6.8-7.0 is best. In addition, irises require soil with a good amount of aeration and drainage.\\nFor heavy, clay-rich soils with bad drainage, try adding humus or organic matter to improve the permeability of the soil.\\nPlanting on a slope or in a raised flower bed can help with drainage \u2014 in these cases, water will naturally run away from the iris.\\n', \"Plant the rhizome so that its top is exposed.:  One common mistake first-timers make when planting irises is to plant them too deep. Unlike most plants, irises do best when their rhizome \u2014 the brown, root-like structure at their base resembling a potato \u2014 is slightly exposed to the air. The plant's roots should be arranged so that they spread downward beneath the rhizome.\\n\\nNote that in very hot climates, covering the rhizomes with a thin layer of dirt (no more than an inch or so) can help protect them from drying out.\\n\", 'Plant the rhizomes so that they are spaced apart.:  More so than other flowers, irises have a tendency to grow together when they\\'re planted near one another. When this happens, the plants can compete for the same soil, water and nutrients, hampering each others\\' growth. To prevent this, try to plant your irises\\' rhizomes at least one to two feet apart.\\nEven with this preventative measure, after a few years, your irises may grow together anyway.

Rather than plant your irises in the soil outside when they're not likely to do well, instead, get them started in a pot. This allows you to carefully control the amount of time that the plants are exposed to the weather outside until it improves and you can transfer them to the garden. If conditions are very bad, like, for instance, if there's heavy frost, you can even keep the plants indoors 24\/7.\\n\\nFor most irises, a 12-inch pot will work well.

If conditions are dry, water every 7 to 10 days or as needed during the morning or evening.\\nOne common mistake to avoid with your irises is over-watering.

In addition, make sure that the soil still has good aeration and drainage \u2014 if it doesn't, add humus or organic matter as needed.\\n\\n\", \"Trim brown or dying leaf matter and the flower stalk.:  Unlike high-maintenance garden plants, iris leaves don't require pruning or trimming for good growth. In fact, leaving the leaves undisturbed even after the growing season allows the iris to gain more nutrients from photosynthesis for next year's growth.\\nNote that, before winter, you may also want to cut the flower stalk to its base. If the flower dies during winter and falls at the base of the plant, it can cause rot to spread to the rhizome as it decays.\\n\", \"Protect the plants in preparation for winter.:  As the plant's roots establish themselves throughout the late summer and early fall, you may want to put some thought to how you plan to protect your irises once the weather grows cold, especially if you live in an area with exceptionally cold winters. Snowfall can naturally protect the soil from the cracking and heaving that can occur during very cold weather and dislodge the rhizomes.\\nIf your area doesn't reliably get snowfall, you may want to spread a loose mulch (like evergreen bough) across the ground to protect the soil.

Repeat until you get back to the starting mark you made.\\n', 'Rotate the chainsaw 180 degrees.:  Loosen your vise or clamp and rotate the chainsaw 180 degrees. This reveals the alternate cutters that you skipped sharpening in the first loop around the chain and means you don\u2019t need to change your stance or method.\\n', 'Use the same motion to sharpen every other tooth.:  Move around the chain again, sharpening each tooth that has not yet been sharpened. Make sure to use the same amount of pressure and run the file through the same amount of times in order to keep each cutter consistent and level.\\n', 'Place a depth gauge over the chain.:  A depth gauge is a tool used to ensure the heights of the rakers are kept at the right height. They should be available at your local hardware store, and may even come with the file. Set the depth gauge over the chain near your starting point and push it forward until it presses against a raker.\\n', 'Check for any part of the raker above the top of the depth gauge.:  Either by observing it or by feeling over the top of the depth gauge for a bump, check whether or not the top of the raker sits higher than the top of the depth gauge. If it does, it will need to be filed down. If not, move the gauge forward to the next raker until you find one that does.\\n', 'Use a flat mill bastard file to level the raker.:  Holding the depth gauge in place, run a flat file over the top of the raker until it is level with the depth gauge. While the depth gauge will protect other teeth from being filed, there is nothing to stop the gauge itself from being filed down. Be careful not to file away the gauge, as this can lead to inconsistencies between rakers.\\nTo entirely avoid filing the gauge, slide it back while you file over the raker. Check the height of the raker consistently as you file until it lines up with the top of the depth gauge.\\nOnce you have filed the raker down, it might have a square top. Use the flat file to very slightly smooth off the edges without filing down the height of the raker any further.\\nA flat file that will work for the rakers should be available at your local hardware store. Unlike the round file, it doesn\u2019t need to be any specific size.\\n', 'File every other raker to the same height.:  Continue the same process of checking rakers with a depth gauge and filing them down all the way around the rest of the chain. Unlike the cutters, you don\u2019t need to worry about filing the same raker twice as you are filing the rakers down.\\n\\n\\n', 'Loosen the chain and release the chainsaw.:  Use the adjustment screws to loosen the chain of your chainsaw back to a usable tension. Loosen the clamp or vise holding the chainsaw in place and take the chainsaw out.

Another tip is to always use pH neutral solutions to avoid damaging your floors, here is some more information.","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Wash Marble Floors', 'description': '\\nMarble is a somewhat soft and porous stone that needs to be cleaned with care. Due to the traffic they get, marble floors, especially, need extra care. There are, thankfully, several ways to safely clean marble floors. By using appropriate cleaning products and avoiding things that could damage your floor, you\u2019ll be better prepared to wash marble floors.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Use hot water.:  Whether you are creating a solution to wash your floor, or just using water, you should use hot water. Hot water will help cut through grime. Ultimately, by using hot water, you\u2019ll decrease the chance that you\u2019ll need tougher solvents that could damage the marble.\\n\\n\\n', 'Focus on distilled water.:  Distilled water is water that has gone through a process to remove minerals and other impurities. By using distilled water, you\u2019ll reduce the chance of discoloring or staining your marble.\\n\\nYou can buy distilled water at just about any grocery store or box store. It is usually cheap.\\n', 'Add a mild detergent to your water.:  Add a mild detergent such as 2-3 drops of dish soap into a bucket with your hot, distilled water. Follow the directions of the soap and dilute it with an appropriate amount of water. Mix your solution thoroughly. Make sure to only add pH neutral soap to your water.\\n\\nHarsh chemical solutions like bleach, hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and vinegar can be damaging to your floors. Avoid using these on marble.\\nIf you prefer, you may be able to use a commercially prepared marble cleaner. Simply follow the directions on the bottle and then clean as you would with a water and detergent solution. Some products include Stone Tech, Resolve, or Simple Green.\\n', 'Use a soft mop on your floor.:  Take a mop with a soft mop head (preferably microfiber) and dip it into your solution of detergent and water. Wring out the mop head to relieve it of excess water and systematically mop your floor. Do short strokes that overlap.\\n\\nRinse and wring out the mop head after you\u2019ve covered 10 to 20 square feet (1 to 2 square meters). This might vary depending on how dirty the floor is.\\n', 'Mop the floor again with clean water.:  After you\u2019ve mopped your floor with a detergent solution, you should mop it again with cool clean water. By mopping it again, you\u2019ll help pick up any dirt or debris that remains on the floor. In addition, you\u2019ll remove any suds that remain on the floor.\\n\\n', 'Change your water frequently.:  When mopping your floors, you need to make sure you change the cleaning solution or water often. If you don\u2019t, your floor might become streaky or could be scratched by debris in the mopping water.\\n\\nIf your water appears brown or you see it full of dirt, dump it. Refill it with new water (and soap, if you want).\\n', 'Use a soft towel to dry the floor.:  Since marble is relatively porous, it\u2019s important to sop up as much of your cleaning solution or water as you possibly can. If you don\u2019t, the solution could leech into the marble and discolor it.\\nSwitch out wet and dirty towels as needed.\\n', 'Wash your floor immediately after a spill.:  All spills on marble should be cleaned up immediately. This is because marble is a porous material and can absorb spills. If you let something sit too long, your marble will discolor or stain.\\n\\nTake a wet microfiber cloth and use it to blot up anything you\u2019ve spilled on the marble floor.\\n', 'Use pH neutral solution.:  pH neutral cleaners won\u2019t damage marble floors. As a result, stay away from acidic cleaners. They might scratch or hurt the shine of marble floors. Avoid:\\n\\nVinegar\\nAmmonia\\nCitrus cleaners (like lemon or orange).\\nCleaners intended for ceramic floors.\\n', 'Do not let your floor air dry.:  One of the worst things you can do to your floor is to let it air dry. By letting it air dry, you\u2019ll allow the water\/solution to soak into the marble. This could stain or discolor the marble.\\n\\n', 'Seal your marble.:  The best way to limit staining on your floor is to seal your marble periodically. Locate a sealing product specifically formulated for marble. Read the directions and apply the seal onto the surface of the marble. Depending on the product (and use), you may have to reseal every three to five years.\\n\\nMake sure to protect other surfaces, such as wood, tile, or grout, with plastic or painters tape.\\nContact a professional if you are uncomfortable sealing your marble floors by yourself.\\n', 'Use a felt pad to remove scuff marks.:  When you come across a scuff or other mark that won\u2019t come off during a normal washing, use a felt pad to remove it. Simply dab the pad in a mixture of detergent and water and rub the marble gently along its grain.\\n\\nDo not rub in a circular pattern. This will damage your marble.\\n', 'Sweep and mop your floors regularly.:  Regularly removing dirt and debris from your marble floors will help prevent future scratching and scuffing. How often you clean your floors will depend on how frequently they get dirty. Aim to remove debris as you notice it.\\nIf, for example, you have children or pets that easily track in dirt, you may need to sweep your floor a few times a week as opposed to once a week.\\n', 'Put down rugs to protect your floors.:  Area rugs and floor runners can help protect your marble floors, especially in high-traffic areas. Use area rugs in places like the living room and rug runners in hallways to prevent scuffing and scratching.\\n\\nAdding a no-slip pad under your rugs will help further protect your floors and keep your rugs in place.\\n', 'Sweep the floor with a soft broom.:  Take a soft dust mop or a broom with soft bristles and sweep the floor. Make sure to sweep up as much debris as you can. Pay special attention to areas along walls or doors.\\n', 'Be careful using a vacuum.:  If you choose to use a vacuum, you need to be careful not to damage your marble floor. The plastic on the nozzle or wheels of a vacuum can etch or scratch marble. As a result, use caution if you decide to use a vacuum\\n\\nIf you have a central vacuum system in your home, you may be able to use a soft floor attachment on the nozzle. However, you should test the attachment in an inconspicuous area (such as behind a door) before using it.\\n', 'Use rugs and mats throughout your home.:  Rugs and mats will help accumulate debris. As a result, sweeping or vacuuming your floor will be easy. In addition, rugs or mats will protect high traffic areas from scratches.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Hot water', 'Bucket', 'Neutral pH detergent or liquid stone soap', 'Mop (preferably microfiber)', 'Microfiber towels', 'Felt pad and powder cleanser for spot removal', 'Sealant']}","extracted_answer":"all spills on marble should be cleaned up immediately","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"I've purchased some pH neutral cleaning solution for marble.

Also, the cap usually states what kind of brake fluid is required. For the vast majority of vehicles, a standard glycol-based DOT 3 or DOT 4 brake fluid should be used.\\nSome brake systems may require DOT 5 fluid, which, because it's silicone-based, has a different chemical composition than DOT 3 and DOT 4 fluids. Conventional vehicle maintenance wisdom dictates that DOT 5 should never be mixed with DOT 3 or DOT 4 fluid or used in systems intended for these types of fluids or it may damage the brakes.\\n\", \"Wipe the reservoir and its cap with a clean, dry rag.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-5116587c60'));\\nGive the top of the reservoir a quick wipe with a lint-free cloth to remove any dirt or debris. This ensures that no loose particles are able to fall into the reservoir and also prevents the brake fluid from dripping onto you or other parts of the engine.\\nIf at any point you get brake fluid on your hands, wash them.

If your reservoir doesn't have these markings, fill it about 2\/3 to 3\/4 full.\\nYou may want to consider using a clean funnel to help prevent spillage. If you do this, however, be sure to clean it using soap and water after use, as brake fluid can be highly caustic.\\n\", \"Consult your manual before beginning.: \\n\\nDraining old brake fluid and replacing it is a substantially more complicated task than simply adding extra fluid. It's also a task with more potential for error. For these reasons, you'll want to consult your vehicle's owner's manual before you get started.

In the next few steps, you'll be getting into and out of the car repeatedly, sometimes adding more new fluid to the reservoir. As you do this, remember\\n\", \"Locate the vehicle's bleed valves.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-41167db0d2'));\\nOn each brake caliper, you should see a small bleed valve on the back side. This usually looks like a bolt with a small nipple on it and sometimes has a rubber protective cap.\\nIn the next few steps, you'll use the bleed valves to let the old, spent brake fluid out of the vehicle's brake lines. Typically, this is done by starting with the rear wheel on the opposite side as the brake fluid reservoir and proceeding through the rest of the wheels in reverse order of  their nearness to the reservoir.\\n\", 'Bleed:  the first wheel.\\nThis is a somewhat complicated process \u2014 see the link in the step title for a detailed guide.\\nBegin by connecting the bleed valve to a clear plastic \"catcher\" container (like an empty soda bottle) with tubing. Ideally, this should be hung or held above the caliper to prevent air from entering the brake system through the valve. Loosen the valve very slightly \u2014 not enough for brake fluid to flow, but enough for it to be easy to loosen it the rest of the way.\\nHave an assistant pump the vehicle\\'s brakes a few times until s\/he notices pressure or resistance from the brake pedal (the vehicle\\'s engine should be off at this point). Once s\/he notices pressure, loosen the bleed valve until fluid begins passing through the tube. The assistant should notice the brake pedal move towards the floor.\\nBe sure to stop bleeding fluid before the pedal reaches the floor \u2014 your assistant should shout to let you know when the pedal is about 2\/3 of the way to the floor. Letting the pedal reach the floor can damage the brakes.\\n', \"Replenish brake fluid as needed.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-1a10cfb50a'));\\nYou never want to let the fluid drop so low that you can no longer see it, as this can introduce air into the brake system.

If necessary, add fresh fluid back to the fill line.\\nRepeat the bleeding procedures above, refilling the fluid in the reservoir as you go, until the fluid passing through the valve is clear and free of air bubbles. Close the bleed screw when finished and make sure it is tight.\\n\", \"Bleed the remaining wheels.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-c19ec6b63e'));\\nOnce you've bled the first wheel as directed above, move on to the rest. As noted previously, the typical order for bleeding a vehicle's brakes is to start with the rear wheel furthest away from the brake fluid reservoir and proceed through the other wheels in reverse order of closeness, ending with the front wheel closest to the reservoir. However, this order may be different for some vehicles, so check the owner's manual.\\nAs one final precaution, observe the fluid level in the reservoir as your assistant depresses the pedal and then abruptly releases the pressure. If the pedal feels spongy, there may still be air bubbles in the brake system, so you'll need to continue bleeding.\\nWhen you've finished with the last wheel and no air bubbles remain in the brake lines, refill the brake fluid reservoir to the fill line and re-cap it.\\n\", \"Reinstall the reservoir cap and wipe the area clean of any excess fluid.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-6398553d9d'));\\nUse a lint-free cloth to wipe up any brake fluid that may have dripped or spilled around the reservoir, taking care not to wipe any debris into the open reservoir itself.\\nDouble-check to ensure that the cap is properly tightened and that the rubber gasket is seated properly before closing the hood and operating the vehicle.

You may also want to have your brakes checked \u2014 a drop in brake fluid level can be a sign of problems with the brake system as a whole, like worn pads.\\nAnother detail to look for is the color of the fluid. When brake fluid is fresh, it\\'s clear with a yellowish tint. With use, brake fluid can gradually grow darker as it accumulates impurities. If your brake fluid is brown or black, simply adding new fluid is not enough \u2014 you\\'ll need to drain the old fluid and replace it.\\nIf there\\'s enough brake fluid in the reservoir and it\\'s not discolored, you may not need to do anything unless your vehicle is scheduled for maintenance. In this case, simply record the date of your inspection for future reference.\\n', \"Use an appropriate brake fluid.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-e619dc86bd'));\\nCheck your vehicle's owner's manual to see if there are any specific instructions for the type of brake fluid you should use. Also, the cap usually states what kind of brake fluid is required. For the vast majority of vehicles, a standard glycol-based DOT 3 or DOT 4 brake fluid should be used.\\nSome brake systems may require DOT 5 fluid, which, because it's silicone-based, has a different chemical composition than DOT 3 and DOT 4 fluids. Conventional vehicle maintenance wisdom dictates that DOT 5 should never be mixed with DOT 3 or DOT 4 fluid or used in systems intended for these types of fluids or it may damage the brakes.\\n\", \"Wipe the reservoir and its cap with a clean, dry rag.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-5116587c60'));\\nGive the top of the reservoir a quick wipe with a lint-free cloth to remove any dirt or debris. This ensures that no loose particles are able to fall into the reservoir and also prevents the brake fluid from dripping onto you or other parts of the engine.\\nIf at any point you get brake fluid on your hands, wash them. Brake fluid is corrosive enough to strip paint from metal, so it's dangerous to leave on your skin for very long.\\nWhen you're done, re-seal the cap and close the hood. Congratulations! You're done.\\n\", \"Remove the reservoir cap and add the brake fluid.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-5ba56bc2fc'));\\nThe actual act of adding extra brake fluid to your vehicle's reservoir is quite easy \u2014 simply pour it through the reservoir hole carefully. Use the minimum and maximum fill lines as a guide, if present. If your reservoir doesn't have these markings, fill it about 2\/3 to 3\/4 full.\\nYou may want to consider using a clean funnel to help prevent spillage. If you do this, however, be sure to clean it using soap and water after use, as brake fluid can be highly caustic.\\n\", \"Consult your manual before beginning.: \\n\\nDraining old brake fluid and replacing it is a substantially more complicated task than simply adding extra fluid. It's also a task with more potential for error. For these reasons, you'll want to consult your vehicle's owner's manual before you get started. This guide may not apply to every vehicle, so it's important to double-check with your manufacturer's instructions to ensure you don't inadvertently do any damage to your vehicle.\\nNote that this is a\\n\", \"Jack the vehicle up and remove its wheels.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-ba311a718d'));\\nTo start, you'll want to raise the vehicle on frame stands. Remove each wheel just as you would if you were replacing the vehicle's tires.\\nA level working surface and secure supports are essential here \u2014 since the vehicle is raised off of the ground, slippage is a rare but potentially deadly possibility.\\n\", \"Fill the reservoir with new brake fluid.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-4cf06d1ed0'));\\nOpen the hood and locate the reservoir as normal. Add extra fluid to the reservoir as normal \u2014 even if the fluid that's already in the reservoir is discolored.\\nWhen you're done, replace the lid. In the next few steps, you'll be getting into and out of the car repeatedly, sometimes adding more new fluid to the reservoir. As you do this, remember\\n\", \"Locate the vehicle's bleed valves.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-41167db0d2'));\\nOn each brake caliper, you should see a small bleed valve on the back side. This usually looks like a bolt with a small nipple on it and sometimes has a rubber protective cap.\\nIn the next few steps, you'll use the bleed valves to let the old, spent brake fluid out of the vehicle's brake lines. Typically, this is done by starting with the rear wheel on the opposite side as the brake fluid reservoir and proceeding through the rest of the wheels in reverse order of  their nearness to the reservoir.\\n\", 'Bleed:  the first wheel.\\nThis is a somewhat complicated process \u2014 see the link in the step title for a detailed guide.\\nBegin by connecting the bleed valve to a clear plastic \"catcher\" container (like an empty soda bottle) with tubing. Ideally, this should be hung or held above the caliper to prevent air from entering the brake system through the valve. Loosen the valve very slightly \u2014 not enough for brake fluid to flow, but enough for it to be easy to loosen it the rest of the way.\\nHave an assistant pump the vehicle\\'s brakes a few times until s\/he notices pressure or resistance from the brake pedal (the vehicle\\'s engine should be off at this point). Once s\/he notices pressure, loosen the bleed valve until fluid begins passing through the tube. The assistant should notice the brake pedal move towards the floor.\\nBe sure to stop bleeding fluid before the pedal reaches the floor \u2014 your assistant should shout to let you know when the pedal is about 2\/3 of the way to the floor. Letting the pedal reach the floor can damage the brakes.\\n', \"Replenish brake fluid as needed.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-1a10cfb50a'));\\nYou never want to let the fluid drop so low that you can no longer see it, as this can introduce air into the brake system.  Check the brake fluid reservoir after each bleeding. If necessary, add fresh fluid back to the fill line.\\nRepeat the bleeding procedures above, refilling the fluid in the reservoir as you go, until the fluid passing through the valve is clear and free of air bubbles. Close the bleed screw when finished and make sure it is tight.\\n\", \"Bleed the remaining wheels.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-c19ec6b63e'));\\nOnce you've bled the first wheel as directed above, move on to the rest. As noted previously, the typical order for bleeding a vehicle's brakes is to start with the rear wheel furthest away from the brake fluid reservoir and proceed through the other wheels in reverse order of closeness, ending with the front wheel closest to the reservoir. However, this order may be different for some vehicles, so check the owner's manual.\\nAs one final precaution, observe the fluid level in the reservoir as your assistant depresses the pedal and then abruptly releases the pressure. If the pedal feels spongy, there may still be air bubbles in the brake system, so you'll need to continue bleeding.\\nWhen you've finished with the last wheel and no air bubbles remain in the brake lines, refill the brake fluid reservoir to the fill line and re-cap it.\\n\", \"Reinstall the reservoir cap and wipe the area clean of any excess fluid.: if (WH.video)WH.video.add(document.getElementById('mvid-6398553d9d'));\\nUse a lint-free cloth to wipe up any brake fluid that may have dripped or spilled around the reservoir, taking care not to wipe any debris into the open reservoir itself.\\nDouble-check to ensure that the cap is properly tightened and that the rubber gasket is seated properly before closing the hood and operating the vehicle. Replace the wheels and carefully lower the vehicle back to the ground.\\nCongratulations! You've just replaced your vehicle's brake fluid and bled its brakes \u2014 not an easy task for beginners.\\n\", \"Make sure to clean up any spills.: \\n\\nIf brake fluid spills onto the ground, don't forget to clean it up \u2014 not only is it a corrosive, somewhat noxious fluid, but also a hazard in terms of slippage.\\nMinor spills can usually be cleaned up with a wet towel or mop. For major spills, absorb the fluid with inert, non-flammable materials like sand, dirt, diatomaceous earth, etc. and shovel this into a waste receptacle.\\nDon't let brake fluid make its way into a storm drain or use brake fluid-soaked dirt etc. be used for purposes like gardening \u2014 brake fluid is toxic and can pose an environmental hazard if it's released into the environment without being properly processed and treated.\\n\"], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"make sure to clean up any spills","question_type":"['navigation']","text_question":"I have replaced the cap, so is that the end of the instructions?","question_id":"diy-71-8","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"return_list_ingredients_tools"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-82","question":"Ok, I am ready to start pruning, but from the picture showing, there are quite a few flowers at the top?

Most tomato plants will grow quite easily and shouldn't require much maintenance over their life.  However, some people find that pruning their tomato plants can help keep the plant healthy and result in more tomatoes.  The pruning process itself is simple and won't require any special tools to get started.\\n\\n\", 'steps': [\"Start at the bottom of the plant.:   It can be helpful to start pruning your tomato plant from the bottom and working your way up.  This will allow you to keep track of your progress and you'll be able to clearly see what needs to be removed as you work.  Carefully work your way up the plant, pruning any non-essential growth away from it.\\nMost of the pruning will take place at the bottom of the plant.\\nNewly formed stems will need to be removed.  These stems take nutrients away from your tomato fruits.\\nMany stems on the lower portion of the plant will not yield fruit.\\n\", \"Remove unwanted stems and leaves.:   Most tomato pruning can be done by pinching off whatever part of the plant needs to be removed.  Hold the part of the plant between your thumb and index finger before gently snapping the piece away.  You may need to move the piece back and forth until it loosens enough to break off.\\nMost sections of the plant should be easily pinched off.\\nPruning shears are not needed unless a piece is too big to break away by hand.\\nUsing pruning shears can open the plant up to possible infection.\\nIf you must cut something from your plant, it's best to use a razor blade.\\n\", \"Don't overdo the pruning.:   It's important that you leave enough leaves and stems for the plant to function properly.  Cutting away too much of the plant can cause it to grow slowly or possibly die.  Removing too many leaves can expose the fruit to the sun and ruin the tomatoes.  If you are in doubt about pruning something, it's best to leave it on.\\nIt can be a good idea to leave at least one stem on each time you prune.  These stems can eventually produce extra tomatoes.\\nYou'll want around 4 or 5 stems on your plant that are producing fruit.\\nIf tomatoes would be exposed to the sun, it's best to leave stems and leaves on that area to provide shade.\\nDon't remove more than 1\/3 of the total plant while pruning.\\n\", \"Prune your plants once a week.:   Pruning your tomatoes will be an ongoing process.  New growth will constantly be underway and you'll want to direct that growth to produce the most tomatoes.  Keep up with your pruning by removing unwanted growth around once a week.\\nPruning too often might remove more of the plant than is necessary.\\nLeaving your plant without pruning could allow for unnecessary growth to occur.\\nHarvesting tomatoes often can result in greater yields throughout the life of the plant.\\n\", \"Prune your plants under the best conditions.:   There are two main things that will help your tomato pruning efforts: the time of day and the weather.  It's recommended that you prune in the mornings, as unwanted stems will break away easier.  It's also important that you prune when the plant is dry to prevent any diseases from affecting your tomato plant.\\n\", \"Know which parts of the plant to prune.:   The goal in pruning your tomato plant will be to remove any non-essential foliage or growth.  To do this, you will need to know which parts of the plant can be removed and which parts need to remain intact.  When pruning your tomato plant, focus on removing these extra parts to help increase the amount of tomatoes produced:\\nMost lower branches can be cut away from the plant.\\nCut away any new stems that are starting to grow from old ones.\\nAny stems that don't have either flower or fruit can be removed.\\nSnap off any dead or discolored leaves.\\n\", \"Consider cutting off the main growth.:   It's common for tomato plants to grow upwards instead of of outwards.  If your tomato plant has grown too high, you may consider pruning the topmost growth stems.  This will prevent the plant from growing upwards, redirecting growth outwards to the tomatoes themselves.\\nCutting off the top of the plant will prevent all upwards growth.  It's a good idea to only do this late in the growing season, before the first frost.\\nWithout the top stem in place, your tomato plant will focus growth into the fruit instead of the stems or leaves.\\n\", 'Learn the two main types of tomato plants.:   If you are going to grow tomatoes on your patio, you will need to make sure they are the variety you want.  There are two main varieties of tomatoes plants: determinate and indeterminate.  Determinate tomato plants will grow in a small bush and are generally well suited to planting in a container.  Indeterminate tomato plants will grow larger than determinate tomatoes, but can be more challenging to grow in a container.\\nDeterminate tomatoes are usually the best type of tomatoes to grow on your patio.\\nDeterminate tomato plants will likely not need to be pruned.\\nIndeterminate tomatoes will usually require a wire or wooden stake to grow properly.\\nIndeterminate tomato plants can benefit from pruning.\\n', 'Get the right size container.:  Your tomato plant will need enough room to grow into. If the container is too small for your plant, it may have difficulty reaching maturity and producing tomatoes. Think about how many tomato plants you want to grow on your patio and select the right size containers for them. Keep in mind that tomato plants can get quite large, too.\\nThe exact amount of room required may vary between types of tomato plants.

A well-maintained gate, on the other hand, can be welcoming and give passers-by a great impression of the house beyond. If you want to upgrade the wooden gate in a privacy fence, or some other kind of wooden security fence, you can learn how to plan out the job properly, build the thing quickly, and finish it off securely.\\n\\n', 'steps': [\"Get the tools and materials necessary to the job.:  Aside from a fence in need of a gate, you'll need a few common hand-held carpentry tools to get started making your gate. It's likely you'll need:\\n\\nScrewdriver\\nPower drill\\nCompound miter saw\\nCarpenter's level\\nJigsaw, for cutting a decorative profile\\n3-inch stainless steel coated deck screws, for putting the box frame together\\n1 \u00bc or 1 \u215d stainless steel or coated deck screws, for planking\\nHinges\\n\", \"Make sure the fence posts can support a gate if you already have a fence.:  The size of the gate should not be greater than 4' (1.22 m) in width. If it is wider, you must make and hang two gates, which will meet in the middle.\\n\\nMeasure the entry at the top and bottom as they can easily be different. Build the gate to be square based on the narrower measure. Take diagonal measurements to check for squareness.\\n\", 'Anchor and plumb the fence posts, if necessary.:  You need to make sure that hanging the gate won\\'t pull the posts to one side. The way you anchor the post will depend on the size of the fence, but in general, you need to make sure the post doesn\\'t wiggle with weight. If it can be easily moved, the gate will sag. You should also check and see that the post is level, straight up and down.\\n\\nIdeally, a 4-foot (1.22 m) tall gate needs a 5\" x 5\" (12.7cm x 12.7 cm) redwood post. A 6-foot (1.83 m) tall gate requires a 6\" x 6\" (15.3 cm x 15.3 m) post. Post length should be at least 1\/3rd longer than the planned height of gate. The hole that the post  will occupy should be at least 6\u201d deeper than post will be buried. Post should be buried at least 1\/3 but preferably 1\/2 of its length and hole should be 3 x as wide as post. Concrete is best for filling hole but gravel or tightly packed earth may have to do. It is best to seal the end of post being buried using old motor oil, water proofing agent, bronzing (lightly charring post) or exterior paint. Giving buried end of post some form of water proofing protection will greatly extend life of post. Post should also be (proved) before using. Proving is allowing post to lay exposed to elements for at least 4 or more days to assure that it won\\'t warp or twist (the longer the better, 2 weeks is best). This is especially important for \\'treated\\' posts that have been bundled (unbundle, separate posts and allow to dry and wait to see if they will remain straight -proving). One doesn\\'t want to come back and find that a post has warped after a week or so.\\n', \"Measure the frame.:  The frame for a basic wooden fence gate should be a simple box with 4 sides, usually somewhat smaller than the gate opening. If you've got a 3x5 opening in the fence, build a 3x4 box out of a weather resistant wood. The box should be about an inch less wide than the rough opening to account for hinges and the thickness of gate as it swings.\\n\\nTypically, you'll want to use the same variety of wood used on the fence. If you want a different color, redwood is sometimes used for large gates. Whatever you choose to use, buy more lumber than you'll need to make sure you've got enough for the job.\\n\", 'Cut 2 x 4 (5.: 08 x 10.16 cm) frame pieces to size with a mitre saw\\n', \"Screw in the top and bottom planks.:  Drill a pilot hole for the screws before putting them in so that they do not split the wood. Fasten with deck screws, pre-drilling to keep the wood from splitting. Measure from the top bend to the opposite bottom corner. Both sides should measure the same.\\n\\nTypically, as you start assembling, the gate framing, it's good to lay it out on a flat surface, such as a patio or driveway. Attach the top and bottom rails to the side rails, making sure it is square.\\n\", 'Cut an angled cross-brace and attach it to the top and bottom rails.:  This helps maintain strength and rigidity. Connect these to the frame boards that match the rest of the fence by using deck screws, pre-drilling as before.\\n\\nMake your diagonal cut with a mitre saw. Place the diagonal onto the box and trance with a pencil where the angles go.\\nPlace the cross-brace at a 45 degree angle extending from the bottom corner of the gate to the opposite corner of the top of the gate.\\n', \"Cut and install the planks.:  Once you've designed the frame and built it, all you need to do now is attach flat planks evenly over the front of the frame to finish your basic wooden gate. Measure planks from the top to the bottom of the frame and cut them accordingly. Leave at least \u215b inch between the planks for weather allowances.\\n\\nCut planks using a table saw and secure them using deck screws, drilling pilot holes to keep your planks nice and clean.\\n\", \"Design the top of the gate.:  Most people like to take a little time to design the top of the gate and add a little decoration to it, using a jigsaw. If you don't want to take the time to, it's not necessary, but it's a good way to make the fence look nice. Generally, a beveled edge, an imprint of your last name, or other little decorative markers are popular.\\n\\nTo start, draw an arc across the top of the fence using a string and a pencil, filling it with decorative curves according to your taste. If you're a woodworker, feel free to get fancy with it. Use the jig to cut along your pattern.\\n\", 'Install hinges and attach the gate to the fence.:  Put the gate into place, supporting it on the bottom with a 2x4 (1.5 inch off ground). Use a pencil to mark where the hinge should go on the post, and then put the gate down. Predrill where the screws will go. Prop up the gate and screw the hinges into the gate and attach the hinges to the post.\\n\\n', \"Install a gravity latch.:  Most easy-to-use fences will use a gravity latch, which you can install after you've hung the fence. Mark where the screws will go with a pencil, then drill pilot holes and install the latch. Get the fit first before you put any finish on the gate.\\n\\n\", 'Seal the wood.:  Try to hit every exposed surface with your sealer, using a paintbrush or garden sprayer to apply. Most home retailers sell pads that are basically a sponge on a stick that you can use to spread it around, if necessary.\\n\\nTry to cover the whole surface evenly, making sure you hit the bottoms of the planks, which tend to absorb more water than the face grains.

","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Build a Wooden Gate', 'description': '\\nA broke-down gate just makes your house look bad. A well-maintained gate, on the other hand, can be welcoming and give passers-by a great impression of the house beyond. If you want to upgrade the wooden gate in a privacy fence, or some other kind of wooden security fence, you can learn how to plan out the job properly, build the thing quickly, and finish it off securely.\\n\\n', 'steps': [\"Get the tools and materials necessary to the job.:  Aside from a fence in need of a gate, you'll need a few common hand-held carpentry tools to get started making your gate. It's likely you'll need:\\n\\nScrewdriver\\nPower drill\\nCompound miter saw\\nCarpenter's level\\nJigsaw, for cutting a decorative profile\\n3-inch stainless steel coated deck screws, for putting the box frame together\\n1 \u00bc or 1 \u215d stainless steel or coated deck screws, for planking\\nHinges\\n\", \"Make sure the fence posts can support a gate if you already have a fence.:  The size of the gate should not be greater than 4' (1.22 m) in width. If it is wider, you must make and hang two gates, which will meet in the middle.\\n\\nMeasure the entry at the top and bottom as they can easily be different. Build the gate to be square based on the narrower measure. Take diagonal measurements to check for squareness.\\n\", 'Anchor and plumb the fence posts, if necessary.:  You need to make sure that hanging the gate won\\'t pull the posts to one side. The way you anchor the post will depend on the size of the fence, but in general, you need to make sure the post doesn\\'t wiggle with weight. If it can be easily moved, the gate will sag. You should also check and see that the post is level, straight up and down.\\n\\nIdeally, a 4-foot (1.22 m) tall gate needs a 5\" x 5\" (12.7cm x 12.7 cm) redwood post. A 6-foot (1.83 m) tall gate requires a 6\" x 6\" (15.3 cm x 15.3 m) post. Post length should be at least 1\/3rd longer than the planned height of gate. The hole that the post  will occupy should be at least 6\u201d deeper than post will be buried. Post should be buried at least 1\/3 but preferably 1\/2 of its length and hole should be 3 x as wide as post. Concrete is best for filling hole but gravel or tightly packed earth may have to do. It is best to seal the end of post being buried using old motor oil, water proofing agent, bronzing (lightly charring post) or exterior paint. Giving buried end of post some form of water proofing protection will greatly extend life of post. Post should also be (proved) before using. Proving is allowing post to lay exposed to elements for at least 4 or more days to assure that it won\\'t warp or twist (the longer the better, 2 weeks is best). This is especially important for \\'treated\\' posts that have been bundled (unbundle, separate posts and allow to dry and wait to see if they will remain straight -proving). One doesn\\'t want to come back and find that a post has warped after a week or so.\\n', \"Measure the frame.:  The frame for a basic wooden fence gate should be a simple box with 4 sides, usually somewhat smaller than the gate opening. If you've got a 3x5 opening in the fence, build a 3x4 box out of a weather resistant wood. The box should be about an inch less wide than the rough opening to account for hinges and the thickness of gate as it swings.\\n\\nTypically, you'll want to use the same variety of wood used on the fence. If you want a different color, redwood is sometimes used for large gates. Whatever you choose to use, buy more lumber than you'll need to make sure you've got enough for the job.\\n\", 'Cut 2 x 4 (5.: 08 x 10.16 cm) frame pieces to size with a mitre saw\\n', \"Screw in the top and bottom planks.:  Drill a pilot hole for the screws before putting them in so that they do not split the wood. Fasten with deck screws, pre-drilling to keep the wood from splitting. Measure from the top bend to the opposite bottom corner. Both sides should measure the same.\\n\\nTypically, as you start assembling, the gate framing, it's good to lay it out on a flat surface, such as a patio or driveway. Attach the top and bottom rails to the side rails, making sure it is square.\\n\", 'Cut an angled cross-brace and attach it to the top and bottom rails.:  This helps maintain strength and rigidity. Connect these to the frame boards that match the rest of the fence by using deck screws, pre-drilling as before.\\n\\nMake your diagonal cut with a mitre saw. Place the diagonal onto the box and trance with a pencil where the angles go.\\nPlace the cross-brace at a 45 degree angle extending from the bottom corner of the gate to the opposite corner of the top of the gate.\\n', \"Cut and install the planks.:  Once you've designed the frame and built it, all you need to do now is attach flat planks evenly over the front of the frame to finish your basic wooden gate. Measure planks from the top to the bottom of the frame and cut them accordingly. Leave at least \u215b inch between the planks for weather allowances.\\n\\nCut planks using a table saw and secure them using deck screws, drilling pilot holes to keep your planks nice and clean.\\n\", \"Design the top of the gate.:  Most people like to take a little time to design the top of the gate and add a little decoration to it, using a jigsaw. If you don't want to take the time to, it's not necessary, but it's a good way to make the fence look nice. Generally, a beveled edge, an imprint of your last name, or other little decorative markers are popular.\\n\\nTo start, draw an arc across the top of the fence using a string and a pencil, filling it with decorative curves according to your taste. If you're a woodworker, feel free to get fancy with it. Use the jig to cut along your pattern.\\n\", 'Install hinges and attach the gate to the fence.:  Put the gate into place, supporting it on the bottom with a 2x4 (1.5 inch off ground). Use a pencil to mark where the hinge should go on the post, and then put the gate down. Predrill where the screws will go. Prop up the gate and screw the hinges into the gate and attach the hinges to the post.\\n\\n', \"Install a gravity latch.:  Most easy-to-use fences will use a gravity latch, which you can install after you've hung the fence. Mark where the screws will go with a pencil, then drill pilot holes and install the latch. Get the fit first before you put any finish on the gate.\\n\\n\", 'Seal the wood.:  Try to hit every exposed surface with your sealer, using a paintbrush or garden sprayer to apply. Most home retailers sell pads that are basically a sponge on a stick that you can use to spread it around, if necessary.\\n\\nTry to cover the whole surface evenly, making sure you hit the bottoms of the planks, which tend to absorb more water than the face grains. This is the area most likely to rot or become discolored. Let dry for a couple hours in dry climates or a day in more humid climates.\\n', 'Use your gate.:  After you finish sealing the wood and have given it plenty of time to dry, your gate is ready to use!

The process involves soaking broccoli seeds overnight, and then keeping them somewhere warm and dark for the next week as they germinate. The key to healthy sprouts is regular rinsing and draining, because this will prevent mold and fungi from growing.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Choose a 1-quart (1-L) glass or plastic jar.:  You can use a dedicated sprouter to sprout broccoli seeds, or you can use a clear glass or plastic jar. A mason jar is ideal, but you can also use a plastic food storage container. A 1-quart (1-L) jar will provide lots of room for the water and for the growing sprouts.\\nUse a sterile sprouter or jar to prevent the growth of pathogens. You can sterilize the jar by running it through the dishwasher, or by washing it in hot, soapy water.\\n', 'Measure the seeds.:  To make about \\n', \"Combine the seeds with filtered water in the jar.:  Cover the seeds with 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6\\xa0cm) of cool, filtered water. The water should be between 60 and 70\\xa0\u00b0F (16 and 21\\xa0\u00b0C). Swirl the water and seeds around together to completely saturate the seeds. If any of the seeds float, push them down in the jar.\\nIf you don't have a thermometer, the water should feel slightly cool.\\n\", 'Cover the jar with cheesecloth.:  Place the cheesecloth over the mouth of the jar and use an elastic band or a mason jar ring to secure it in place. You can also screw on a dedicated sprouting lid with a built-in screen if you have one.\\nUsing cheesecloth or mesh will allow airflow into the jar, but will keep dirt, bugs, and particulate out.\\nYou can also use a clean tea towel in place of the cheesecloth.\\n', 'Transfer the seeds to a warm, dark place.:  This will help to replicate the conditions the seeds experience in the soil, and will encourage germination. Ideal places include a kitchen cabinet, cupboard, or pantry.\\n\\n', 'Soak the seeds for about 8 hours.:  Leave the seeds in the water in the pantry overnight, or for 8 to 10 hours. This will kickstart the germination process and help the sprouts to grow faster.\\n', \"Drain and rinse the seeds.:  Once the seeds have been soaking for about 8 hours, remove the cheesecloth and transfer the seeds to a fine-mesh colander. Turn on the water and rinse the seeds for about a minute to remove any dirt or plant matter.\\n\\nIf you're using a sprouting cap with a built-in screen, simply drain the water by slowly turning the jar upside down. Pour in some fresh water, swirl the water and seeds around in the jar, and then pour out the water again.\\nAfter you drain the water, place the jar upside down at a 45-degree angle for 30 minutes so that all of the water in the jar drains out.\\n\", 'Return the seeds to the jar.:  Use a clean spoon to transfer the rinsed seeds back to the sprouting jar. Replace the cheesecloth and secure it in place with the elastic. Place the seeds back in the same warm, dark location that you used for soaking them.\\n\\n', \"Rinse and drain the seeds every 6 to 8 hours for up to 4 days.:  Over the next 3 to 4 days, the seeds will germinate and begin to sprout. It's important to continue rinsing and draining them frequently during this process. Regular rinsing will prevent the growth of mold and bacteria that could cause food poisoning.\\nAs the sprouts grow, they will develop root hairs, which look fuzzy and are sometimes mistaken for mold. Root hairs help the sprouts absorb water, and they are completely normal. After rinsing, you won't even see them.\\n\", \"Move the sprouts to indirect sunlight after 3 to 4 days.:  When the sprouts are about 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) long and have grown yellow leaves, move them to a bright location to encourage chlorophyll growth. This will turn the leaves from yellow to green, and increase the amount of nutrients in the sprouts. A room temperature location, such as a kitchen counter, is an ideal place for this greening process.\\nDon't put the sprouts in direct sunlight, otherwise they will burn.\\n\", 'Continue rinsing every 6 to 8 hours for another 1 to 2 days.:  The sprouts are still susceptible to mold at this point, so you have to keep rinsing every 6 to 8 hours as the sprouts green. Once the leaves on the sprouts turn dark green in a day or 2, the sprouts are ready to eat.\\n', \"Remove the hulls.:  When the leaves are dark green, transfer the sprouts to a large bowl. Cover the sprouts with water and gently agitate the sprouts with a clean hand to loosen the hulls. Use your hand or a small fine-mesh strainer to skim the surface of the water and collect the hulls.\\n\\nBroccoli hulls can hold a lot of water, and this can lead to premature spoilage if you don't remove them.\\n\", 'Rinse and drain the sprouts one last time.:  Transfer the hulled sprouts to a fine-mesh colander to drain the water. Rinse the sprouts with clean water and then leave them to drain for about an hour. After an hour, transfer the sprouts to a clean tea towel to air dry for several hours.\\n\\nDrying the sprouts before storing them will help to preserve them longer.\\n', 'Store leftover sprouts in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.:  When the sprouts are dry, transfer them to a mason jar or other container with an airtight lid. Transfer the sprouts to the refrigerator and store them for 1 to 2 weeks.\\n\\n', 'Eat the sprouts:  on their own.\\nHummus\\nVegetable dip\\nSpinach dip\\nYogurt sauce\\n', 'Add the sprouts to salads.:  Sprouts are the perfect addition to any \\nRanch\\nCaesar\\nFruity vinaigrette\\nBlue cheese\\nItalian\\nPoppy seed\\n', \"Use them as a sandwich topping.:  Just like with salads, fresh sprouts are also great for sandwiches because they're mild but add a bit of crunch. For a quick and easy vegetable sandwich, toast and butter two pieces of your favorite bread, add some sliced tomato, avocado, and onion, and top everything with an ounce (28 g) of sprouts.\\n\\nFor a slightly more gourmet sandwich, don't toast the bread at the beginning. Instead, add a few slices of your favorite cheese and finish the sandwich in a panini maker.\\nYou can add sprouts to any type of sandwich you like, such as a Reuben or a BLT.\\n\"], 'ingredients': ['1-quart (1-L) glass jar', 'Broccoli seeds', 'Water', 'Cheesecloth', 'Elastic band', 'Fine-mesh colander', 'Large bowl']}","extracted_answer":"move the sprouts to indirect sunlight after 3 to 4 days","question_type":"['navigation', 'history']","text_question":"These sprouted well, what's done with them afterwards?","question_id":"diy-97-10","intent_question":"request_next_step","intent_answer":"ask_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-99","question":"Can I use plastic as my base?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Do-Mosaics","data_split":"train","original_answer":"Yes you can.

In essence, your buffet is the centerpiece of your event, so you should put a lot of time and effort into making it engaging. By choosing a theme, getting a tasteful amount of decorations, creating a logical progression for your guests, and doing a trial run, you can ensure that your table will be decorated beautifully and conveniently for your event.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Choose a color theme.:  Your table will be much more cohesive if there is a theme to your decorations. The theme can be either a color or an event, such as a birthday, a season, or a specific holiday. If the theme is a color instead of an event, limit yourself to 2-3 colors that go well together.\\n\\nIf the theme is a holiday, choose colors that correspond with that holiday. For example, if it is a Christmas buffet, use decorations that are red, green, and gold.\\n', 'Buy or make items related to your theme.:  Create a centerpiece that incorporates your theme using fruit, flowers, props, or candles. You can then choose items that hint at that theme for the rest of the table, such as edible garnish, flowers, fruit, leaves, or cinnamon sticks.\\n\\nSome other ideas for table decorations, depending on your theme, are ribbons or seashells.\\n', \"Avoid overdoing the decorations.:  You want the decorations to be classy, not gaudy or overwhelming. Ideally, the food will be on display and any d\u00e9cor around the table will enhance the look of the food, not hide it or overwhelm it.\\n\\nAlso, avoid sprinkling the table with glitter or other non-edible decorations, as these often end up on people's plates or in their mouths.\\n\", 'Coordinate your tablecloth, a table runner, napkins, and placemats.:  Choose either a tablecloth or a table runner to place beneath the food on the buffet table. Napkins are a must as well. Placemats are optional, but can be a nice touch to have beneath your serving dishes. When choosing these items, be sure that they are within your color scheme and that they go well with one another.\\n\\nConsider oversized cloth napkins in colors that match your theme. For a more casual buffet, paper napkins are just fine. No matter what, supply plenty of spare napkins in case of a mess.\\nTable runners should hang about 6 inches (15\\xa0cm) down the table on both sides.\\n', 'Prepare a label for each food item.:   Make labels for each dish that you will have on the table. Use cardstock or paper folded in half, with the name of the dish written on one side. Write or type in a bold, clear font that is large enough for any guest to read.\\n\\nWrite whether a dish is vegetarian, vegan, or gluten free on the label, beneath the name of the dish.\\n', 'Consider making a menu to display.:  For an extra touch, you can create a menu of all the different foods that will be served. Display the menu either using a small menu easel on the table or a stand beside the beginning of the table. That way, guests will know what they will find further down the table and can make more informed food choices.\\n\\n', 'Plan your arrangement before you begin placing the decorations.:  This will prevent you from wasting time rearranging it. Decide which decorations you want to use, where they will go, and what direction you want the guests to follow.\\n\\n', 'Set up a logical journey down the table.:  Imagine yourself starting at the beginning of the table, picking up a plate, dishing up an appetizer and a salad, and then moving down to the main course dish. Think about the order that you would eat a meal in, and arrange the food dishes in that order.\\n\\n', 'Move your buffet table to a convenient location.:  It needs to be visible, but not in people\u2019s way. If you have a lot of guests and your room is large, set the table away from any walls so that your guests have access to the table from both sides. If the room is smaller, place the table against a wall, out of the way. If possible, leave space for people to stand on either  end of the table to avoid too much crowding in the front.\\n\\n', 'Lay down your tablecloth or table runner.:  Either of these will create a lovely base for the buffet table, and can mask a table that you may not want to be shown. If you use a table runner, position it in the center of the table and make sure that it runs the full length of the table.\\n\\n', 'Put the plates and bowls at the beginning of the buffet table.:  Plates are the first thing your guests will need, so they should be at the beginning of the table.\\n', 'Place the utensils at the end of the table.:  Having the utensils at the end of the table relieves people from having to hold them while trying to hold their plate and serve themselves food.\\nProvide all of the utensils that will be needed for the food you\u2019re serving. For example, don\u2019t forget the soup spoons if you\u2019re serving soup!\\n', 'Set the napkins near the utensils, or wrap the utensils in the napkins.: wrap the utensils in the napkins\\n', 'Have multiple stacks of plates, cups, utensils, and napkins.:  Since hungry people can be very eager to get what they need and sit down, it is best to have multiple stacks of plates, cups, utensils, and napkins. That way, many people can grab one at the same time without needing to wait in a line or push into each other.\\n', 'Leave space for people to momentarily set their plates down.:  This step is often missed but is very important. If a guest needs to grab another napkin or adjust something, you want them to have space to set their plate down for a moment.

To soak the medium:\\nFill the new orchid pot with as much growing medium as you'll need to repot the orchid\\nTransfer the medium to a bucket that\u2019s about twice as large as the new pot\\nFill the bucket the rest of the way with water\\nLet the medium soak for one to two hours\\nStrain the medium through a fine-mesh strainer\\nPour running water over the medium to remove dust\\n\", \"Sterilize a cutting tool.:  Once you remove the orchid from its current pot, you'll need a sterilized knife or scissors to trim dead roots and leaves. It\u2019s important to use a sterilized tool to prevent the spread of viruses and diseases.\\n\\nOne way to sterilize your cutting tool is by holding it over an open flame until the metal glows red hot.\\nYou can also soak the knife or scissors in a disinfectant, such as iodine or alcohol. Soak for about 20 minutes.\\nAnother way to sterilize your instrument is by boiling it in water for 20 minutes.\\n\", 'Remove the orchid from the pot.:  Place your hand over the base of the orchid so your hand covers the top of the pot. Hold the pot with your other hand, and gently turn the orchid upside down into the hand that\u2019s cradling the plant.\\n\\nIf the orchid is clinging to the pot, massage it out by gently wiggling it back and forth.\\nOnly cut roots or stems if you cannot gently shake the orchid loose from the pot. If you have to make any cuts, preserve as much of the root or stem as possible.\\n', 'Rinse the roots.:  While still holding the plant carefully with one hand, gently pick away as much old medium as possible with your fingers. When you\u2019ve removed the bulk of the medium, rinse the roots under warm water to remove the remainder.\\nRemoving all the old medium will ensure that your orchid gets the most nutrients possible when you transplant it, and will make sure any bugs are destroyed.\\n', \"Trim dead roots and leaves.:  Once your orchid is clean, inspect it carefully for dead leaves, stems, roots, and pseudobulbs. Use your sterilized cutting tool to trim away any roots that are soft and brown, any leaves that are yellowing, and any pseudobulbs that are black and shrivelled.\\n\\nA pseudobulb is a feature on some orchid types. It\u2019s a bulbous growth near the base of the plant that will have a leaf growing from it.\\nIf you're transplanting multiple orchids at once, sterilize your cutting tool in between plants by wiping it with a disinfectant or heating it with a flame.\\n\", 'Sprinkle cut ends with cinnamon.:  Cinnamon is a powerful fungicide that can help protect the orchid from infection and rot. Use ground cinnamon and sprinkle the ends of any roots, stems, pseudobulbs, or leaves that you trimmed off.\\nYou can also use an orchid-specific fungicide.\\n', 'Place the orchid into its new pot.:  Gently bring your orchid to its new pot and place the roots inside. Make sure the plant sits in the new pot at the same depth as it did in the old one, or so that the lowest leaf\u2019s base is a half-inch (1.3 cm) lower than the pot\u2019s rim.\\nFor orchids with pseudobulbs, position the orchid so the pseudobulb is at the edge of the pot.\\nFor orchids growing from a single major stem, position the orchid in the center of the pot.\\n', 'Add fresh growing medium.:  Sprinkle the growing medium into the pot, and use your fingers to gently press the medium in and around the roots. Add enough medium so that it comes up to the base of the orchid.\\n\\nWhen you\u2019ve added all the medium and packed it loosely around the roots, carefully tilt the pot from side to side to make sure the orchid doesn\u2019t flop around. If it does, pack in a bit more medium.\\nTo settle the medium in place, pick up the pot and gently tap the bottom against a flat surface a couple times.\\n', 'Water the plant.:  Spray the orchid with water for three weeks, but only after the roots begin to grow. Once the orchid is settled in its new pot, add enough water to soak the medium thoroughly. Over the next few weeks, you may have to water the orchid more frequently until the medium is able to absorb and retain more moisture.\\n\\nOnce the orchid is fully established, water it every two weeks or so, when the medium becomes dry to the touch.\\nMake sure that you fertilize your orchid once per week using a weak 20-20-20 fertilizer solution.\\n', 'Add a stake for security.:  Orchids can easily become top heavy if they have a lot of flowers that bloom at once. Prevent them from slumping over by attaching the plant to a stake.\\n\\nInsert a thin bamboo stake into the center of the pot.\\nGently tie the main stem to the stake with soft string. Tie the plant at the middle and near the top.\\n', 'Provide the orchid with more humidity and shade for a week.:  To reduce the plant\u2019s stress from being repotted, move it somewhere that gets filtered sun only. Keep it out of full and direct sunlight for about a week. To provide more humidity, mist the stems, leaves, and roots twice a day for a week.\\nYou can also cover the orchid with fleece to help provide extra humidity.\\nAfter a week, return the orchid to its regular place. Orchids like bright, filtered sunlight\u2014about 3\u20135\\xa0ft (0.91\u20131.52\\xa0m) from a window is ideal.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"choosing a pot thats just 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) larger than the current one","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"Can you specify exactly how shallow the pot should be?","question_id":"diy-105-3","intent_question":"ask_question_ingredients_tools","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-106","question":"How do I locate the defective breaker?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Change-a-Circuit-Breaker","data_split":"train","original_answer":"You want to look for the circuit breaker that stands out from the others","history":"student: The circuit looks good!

What should I do next, at any rate? | teacher: Now you want to locate the defective breaker","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Change a Circuit Breaker', 'description': '\\nA circuit breaker is designed to stop the power flow through a circuit if there is an excessive amperage drawn on said circuit. Occasionally, these breakers go bad and will need to be changed. It is highly recommended that you hire a licensed, competent, and insured electrician to perform this task, as electricity can be deadly. However, if you choose to replace a circuit breaker yourself, you\u2019ll need to know how to find the breaker box, take note of any issues, and replace a faulty breaker to get your power working again.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Find the circuit breaker box.:  Some homes will have multiple breaker boxes in different places. Find both the main circuit breaker box and the one you need to replace a circuit breaker in.\\n', 'Inspect the exterior of the breaker panel for damage or discoloration.:  Before you begin working on any breaker boxes, you should make sure they are still in a safe condition. Any damage or contamination to the box may make it unsafe to work on.\\n\\nLook for any signs of rust, discoloration, charring or moisture when you first examine the circuit breaker box and throughout the process. If you see anything that seems dangerous or unexpected, call an electrician.\\nBeware of certain types of panels, specifically those bearing one of the following names: Federal Pacific Electric, Federal Pioneer, Zinsco, Kearney, GTE Sylvania, or Stab-lok. The safety of these panels is highly debated.\\n', 'Use rubber-insulated tools, gloves, and shoes.:  Electricity can be incredibly dangerous to work around, so take all precautions when trying to reduce the chance of an electrical shock.\\nIf you don\u2019t have rubber-soled shoes or if you want to take further precautions, put down a rubber mat below the circuit breaker box. If the area around the breaker box is damp or otherwise unsafe, call an electrician.\\n', \"Locate the defective breaker.:  You should only replace a circuit breaker that has broken or been damaged in some way. If a circuit breaker is damaged, it will likely have tripped, cutting power to the section of the home it controls. Look through your breaker box for the circuit breaker which stands out from the others. Generally, a tripped circuit breaker switch will be halfway between the on and off positions.\\nBreakers trip because they're over capacity, often because there are too many items plugged into the same circuit at the same time. If this is a recurring problem, you may need to run an additional circuit and install a second circuit breaker.\\nIf a breaker trips repeatedly over a long period of time, it may become defective, in which case it will need to be replaced.\\n\", 'Test the faulty breaker.:  Before you replace a circuit breaker, make sure the breaker itself is faulty and not just overloaded. Unplug and switch off all light and electrical devices in the section of your home controlled by the circuit breaker. Then, turn the breaker switch completely off and back on again. Plug one device back in to see if it is powered to indicate if the breaker is allowing any power through or if it is completely broken.\\nIf the circuit is overloaded and that is causing the breaker to trip, it is working properly. You\u2019ll likely need to reduce the power usage in that section of your home rather than replacing the breaker.\\nIf you think the breaker is tripping without being overloaded, it may be wearing out and have a reduced capacity for amperage. If you think this is the case, you should\\n', 'Test the voltage of the circuit breaker.:  If you want to test the circuit breaker more specifically, you can do so with a voltage tester. To do so, unscrew and remove the faceplate, and press one lead to the neutral wire in the breaker box. Press the other lead to the screw on the circuit breaker. The voltage tester should display how much power is being allowed through the breaker.\\nKeep in mind that if you have a double pole circuit breaker, it pulls from both of the hot wires that are powering the circuit panel, so it will have about twice the voltage.\\nOnly touch the components you need to touch, and only with the leads on the voltage tester. The power will need to be on for this to work, so be very careful.\\n', 'Turn off all power and all individual breakers.:  Before doing any work on a circuit breaker or in the breaker box, make sure you have turned off all the power going to it. If you have a main box and other branch boxes around your home, turn off the power to the branch box at the main box first. Otherwise, just turn off the main power followed by all breakers.\\nEven once you have turned the power off, you should act as if it\u2019s still on.\\nIf you are turning off the main power, or the power to the area around you, the lights will likely turn off as well. Keep an alternative light source nearby so you don\u2019t have to work in the dark.\\n', 'Unscrew and remove the faceplate.:  While the circuit breaker box will allow you to switch breakers on and off, this will not give you access to the entire circuit breaker. Find the screws in each corner of the breaker box and carefully remove them to free the faceplate. Holding the edges, lift the faceplate directly away from the breaker box before lowering it.\\nAlways remove the panel by pulling it towards you and then sliding it down. Don\u2019t let it touch or bump anything inside the circuit breaker box as you are removing it.\\nPut the screws and the faceplate somewhere you can easily find them when needed. While the screws can be replaced, it\u2019s much easier to keep them in a safe place while they\u2019re not attached to the breaker box.\\n', 'Inspect the interior of the panel for damage or discoloration.:  Before you touch anything inside the panel of the breaker box, look for signs of damage. If you see anything that seems unsafe or out of the ordinary, stop immediately and call a licensed electrician.\\n\\nKeep an eye out for any rust, moisture, signs of pests, loose wires, melting, discoloration, charring, heat marking, strange wiring, multiple wires connected to one screw, damaged wiring, debris, or multiple colored wires connected to each other. These can all be dangerous.\\n', 'Pull out the faulty breaker.:  When touching items inside the circuit breaker box, always be careful to only touch the components you need to. With a firm grip, grasp the defective circuit breaker. Start lifting the side that faces towards the center of the panel, with the aim of pivoting it up and out from the breaker panel. Once it is free, unhook it from the hinge on the edge of the panel and pull the breaker free.\\n', 'Disconnect the wire on the circuit breaker.:  The wire connected to the circuit breaker will be held in by a flathead screw on one side. Use a flat-head screwdriver to loosen this screw slightly, without unscrewing and removing it completely. Separate the wire from the circuit breaker once the screw is loose enough.\\nAlways keep track of loose wires, as they can be incredibly dangerous. Tuck the wire into the circuit breaker box to keep it out of the way. Make sure you know which wire you have disconnected, as you\u2019ll need to reconnect it when you install a new circuit breaker.\\n', 'Note the exact amperage and type of the circuit breaker.:  The circuit breaker replacement will need to be the exact same type as the faulty one you remove.\\n', 'Dispose of the faulty circuit breaker.:  While a circuit breaker may feel heavy, there is very little value to any of its components.\\n', 'Find a new circuit breaker of the same type as the faulty one.:  The new circuit breaker will need to be exactly the same type as the one you are replacing.\\nIf the circuit breaker you are replacing is a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) or AFCI (Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter) breaker, as sometimes used for outdoor, bedroom, garage, kitchen or bathroom circuits, be sure that you replace it with another one of the same type.\\n', 'Clip the new circuit breaker in place.:  Using the opposite motion to removing the faulty breaker, firmly clip your new circuit breaker into place. Position the end without a screw under the hook on the breaker box panel, and pivot the breaker down until it clicks into place securely.\\n', 'Reattach the loose wire.:  Firmly hold your circuit breaker and connect the wire to the loose screw.\\nIt may help to use a pair of needle-nose pliers to hold the wire in place as you tighten the screw.\\nWhile the screw should be tight, you do not need to over-tighten it. Make sure it is secure, but don\u2019t risk squeezing the wires to the point of damage.\\nMake sure the rubber insulation on the wire does not touch the screw or the circuit breaker, as it may be damaged or melt over time.\\n', 'Reattach the faceplate.:  Carefully lift the faceplate in line with the breaker box and install it back in place. Using the same screws that came out of the faceplate, tightly secure the faceplate to the rest of the breaker box.\\nAlways use a screw of the same length and type when reattaching the faceplate. If the screws are too long or have a pointed end like wood screws, they may screw in too deep and damage the wiring.\\n', 'Turn the power back on.:  If you have a main breaker box, turn on the power to your branch breaker box first. Turn on the main power in the breaker box, followed by each circuit breaker one by one.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Voltage sniffer', 'Multimeter', \"Lineman's gloves\", 'A rubber mat', \"Insulated lineman's tools\", 'Rubber-soled shoes', 'Safety glasses', 'An observer', 'Replacement circuit breaker', 'Flashlight']}","extracted_answer":"tripped circuit breaker switch will be halfway between the on and off positions","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"How do I locate the defective breaker?","question_id":"diy-106-3","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-107","question":"What is the safest way to check if the light has been properly installed?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Change-a-Pool-Light","data_split":"train","original_answer":"The safest way to check any electrical device is to ensure that the power is shut off first.

","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Stake Tomato Plants', 'description': '\\nIt\u2019s necessary to support tomatoes as they grow so that they\u2019re cleaner, less susceptible to disease, and able to become fully ripe. There are many ways that you can stake your tomato plants so that they stay supported and off of the ground. Consider going the traditional route and using single stakes. You can also try to stake them using other methods, including caging and using trellises.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Plant your tomatoes:  2\u20134 feet (0.61\u20131.2\\xa0m) (0.6-1.2 m) apart to accommodate staking.\\nYou can purchase transplants from a local garden center. If you\u2019d rather grow your tomatoes from seed, start germinating them indoors 6-8 weeks before the last spring frost.\\n', 'Purchase 6-8 foot (1.8-2.4 m) stakes.:  If you\u2019re supporting your tomato plants with single stakes, go to your local garden center and purchase ones made of wood, plastic, or bamboo. Make sure these stakes are somewhere between 6 and 8 feet (1.8-2.4 m) tall so that the plants can continue to grow and be properly supported.\\nSingle stakes are easy to install, remove, and store. They also make harvesting a quick, simple process.\\nIf you are using wooden stakes to support the tomato plants, do not use treated wood. This can cause chemicals to be transferred into the ground.\\n', 'Place the tip of the stake 3-6 inches (7.6-15.2 cm) away from the plant.:  \\n', 'Insert the stake 6-8 inches (15.2-20.3 cm) into the ground.:  Use a hammer or mallet to pound each stake at least 6-8 inches (15.2-20.3 cm) deep into the ground so that they\u2019re strong and stable.\\n', 'Tie the main stem to the stake:  once the plant is 6 inches (15.2 cm) tall.\\nThe stems will be soft and can become damaged easily, so it\u2019s important to keep the ties as loose as possible while also keeping them tight enough to hold the plant up.\\n', 'Continue tying the stem to the stake as it grows.:  Monitor the plant\u2019s growth and tie the main stem to the stake every time it grows another 6-8 inches (15.2-20.3 cm). This will keep the tomato plant supported and growing in the right direction.\\n', 'Prune the tomato plants\u2019 suckers.:  This will make the plant\u2019s stems stronger and allow the plant to grow bigger tomatoes. Check the tomato plants every few days for side stems, or \u201csuckers,\u201d that grow in between the main stem and the leaves. Use your fingers to snap them off or snip with hand pruners.\\n', 'Remove, clean, and store the stakes in the fall.:  In autumn, harvest is over and the plants will no longer produce tomatoes. At this point, untie your ties and pull your stakes out of the ground. Spray a disinfecting solution on the stakes, allow them to air dry, and bundle them with a strong rope. Keep them properly stored indoors in a cool, dry area until spring.\\nIf you want to make your own disinfectant spray, fill a bottle with 9 parts water and 1 part bleach and then shake it up before spraying.\\nConsider storing your stakes in a garage or barn.\\n', 'Plant your tomatoes:  4 feet (1.2\\xa0m) (1.2 m) apart to accommodate caging.\\nIf you want to grow the plants from seed, start germinating the seeds inside 6-8 weeks before the last frost of the spring.\\n', 'Purchase downward tapering cylindrical cages.:  Go to a local garden center and purchase wire tomato cages. These typically have a cylindrical shape that\u2019s more narrow at the base and wider towards the top.\\nIf you have bigger plants, it might be best to make cages yourself. Roll a 5 foot (1.5 m) by 5 foot (1.5 m) section of wire fencing into a cylinder. Secure it to the ground with 2-foot (0.6 m) stakes made of wood or rebar.\\nCages are appealing because, once they\u2019re placed over the plant, you won\u2019t need to prune them. This allows the plant\u2019s leaves to grow and protect the tomatoes from the sun.\\nPotted tomato plants need support, too. Use a single stake or a tomato cage that will fit in your pot.\\n', 'Spread a layer of mulch on top of the soil to prevent mold.:  Because caged tomatoes are leafier, they\u2019re more susceptible to mold and fungus. Spread a layer of mulch evenly on the surface of the soil around the base of the plant to keep this from becoming an issue.\\n\\nYou can also help prevent mold by watering the soil directly instead of watering the leaves and tomatoes.\\n', 'Put the cage over the plant and into the ground just after planting.:  Place the wire cages overtop of each plant and push the \u201clegs\u201d on the bottom of the cage into the ground. This will keep the cage stable. Whether your tomato plants are newly-sprouted seedlings or hearty transplants, do this immediately after planting to keep from damaging the plant\u2019s roots.\\n', 'Pull the stems through the cage as the plant grows.:  The horizontal wires on the cage are what provide support to the tomato plants. Check on each plant\u2019s growth every few days. When the plant has grown tall enough to reach the next horizontal wire, gently pull that part of the plant through the cage so that it can rest on the wire.\\n', 'Remove, clean, and store the cages in the fall.:  Once the weather gets cooler and there aren\u2019t any tomatoes to harvest, pull the cages out of the ground and spray them down with a cleaning solution. Let them air dry and then stack them up in a cool, dry garage or barn until spring.\\nMake an easy cleaning solution by mixing 9 parts water and 1 part bleach.\\n', 'Support your plants with a trellis.:  Wire trellises combine the concepts of single stakes and cages. To build one, pound 6 foot (1.8) poles or stakes into the ground about 10 feet (3 m) apart. Then staple or tie wire fencing to the poles so that it connects them horizontally. Plant the tomato plants about 4 feet (1.2\\xa0m) (1.2 m) apart underneath the wire and train the plants to grow up and use the wire as support.\\nWhile keeping it attached to the spool, use garden twine to tie a loop around the base of a tomato plant. Then unravel the spool while you wind it around the plant 2-3 times. Continue unraveling the spool until the twine is long enough to reach the top of the trellis. Then, cut and tie the twine to the top of the structure.\\n', 'Try the Florida weave.:  Install posts just like you would with a wire trellis, and then tie long pieces of tomato twine around one of the end posts at multiple heights. Then weave the twine around the other posts and ultimately tie them to the post that\u2019s furthest away on the other end. \\nTie a loop around the base of each plant with one end of a new piece of twine and tie the other end to the topmost woven piece of twine that makes up the structure. This way, the plants will grow up and in between the twine.\\n', 'Use tripods and tuteurs in windy areas.:  Get three large 6-foot (1.8m) stakes made of wood or bamboo for each tomato plant. Wrap 2-3 thick, elastic bands around the tops of all 3 stakes and insert each end into the ground around the outside of the plant. This will provide maximum support, which is beneficial and often necessary when growing tomato plants in windy locations.\\n\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Hand shovel', 'Manure, fertilizer, or compost', 'Tomato transplants or seeds', 'Stakes', 'Mallet or Hammer', 'Measuring tape', 'Garden twine, fabric strips, or pantyhose', 'Cleaning solution', 'Hand shovel', 'Manure, fertilizer, or compost', 'Tomato transplants or seeds', 'Mulch', 'Wire cages or wire fencing', 'Measuring tape', 'Cleaning solution', 'Poles or stakes', 'Wire fencing', 'Measuring tape', 'Tomato twine', 'Elastic bands']}","extracted_answer":"tie the main stem to the stake:  once the plant is 6 inches (15.2 cm) tall","question_type":"['confirmation']","text_question":"Does that mean the plant shouldn't be tied to the stake right away?","question_id":"diy-115-3","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-117","question":"What is the concrete supposed to be used for?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Dry-Firewood","data_split":"train","original_answer":"The concrete is to create a raised bed to keep your firewood off of the bare ground to avoid rot.

Even if it does burn, wet wood gives off less heat, dies quickly, and creates more smoke and soot. Drying wood effectively does take time, though, so it\u2019s best to plan at least six months ahead. But once you cut the wood to the size needed and stack it carefully, all you need to do is wait for the sun and air to dry it out.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Gather wood early.:  Purchase or cut down your firewood no less than six months before you plan to burn it. For best results, do so even earlier to give it that much more time to air-dry. If possible, collect wood a year in advance in order to ensure thorough seasoning.\\nClimate can affect drying times. Allow for more time if you live in a particularly wet region.\\nMore time is also required for denser species of wood, like elm and oak.\\n', 'Choose a safe work area.:  Unless you purchased firewood that has already been split, pick an open area outside to cut and split the wood yourself. Make sure the area is open enough for you to handle a saw and\/or ax without interference from any obstructions. Favor level ground over uneven ground to ensure good footing as you work.\\nKeep people and pets well away from the work area. Once you begin cutting and splitting, check behind you frequently to make sure no one is approaching.\\n', 'Cut whole logs into uniform \u201crounds.\u201d:  First, measure the dimensions of your fireplace, furnace, or any other area where you will burn wood. Then subtract three inches (7.6 cm) from either its length or width, based on how the wood needs to be inserted into that space. Use this figure to measure and mark where to cut each whole log. Divide them into rounds of equal length with a saw or ax.\\nSince wood shrinks as it dries, some people prefer to cut larger-than-needed rounds.\\nIf you live in a wet climate, cut even smaller rounds, since these will dry faster.\\nCutting uniform lengths of wood will make stacking them easier.\\n', 'Split the wood.:  Place your chopping block on level ground. Set a round on top with a cut side facing up. Saw or chop the round into halves from the top down.\\nSplit the wood at least once even if your wood burner will fit a whole round. Since the wood\u2019s bark seals in moisture, it is critical to expose as much of the inner wood as possible.\\nFor a quicker drying time, split the wood into smaller pieces than needed.\\nAdditionally, split the wood into a variety of sizes. Create small pieces for kindling as well as larger pieces that will burn longer.\\n', 'Choose an area ideal for stacking.:  Pick an outdoor space that receives little to no shade in order to maximize solar drying. Utilize the air by selecting an area that is open to prevailing winds or other air currents.\\nRefer to almanacs or weather stations to determine the direction of your region\u2019s prevailing winds.\\nIf your land is especially hilly, expect air currents to move up and down the face of hills.\\n', 'Map out your row(s).:  If possible, plan to stack your wood in a single row, with the cut ends receiving the strongest air currents head-on.\\nIf space does not permit one long row of wood, space your row as far apart from each other as possible to allow the most airflow between them.\\n', \"Create a raised bed.:  Keep your firewood off bare ground. Avoid rot from moisture that collects below. Use material that won\u2019t absorb water, such as concrete or a grid made of poles laid horizontally.\\nIf you use wood, line the top of the bed with tarps, plastic sheeting, or similar materials to block the transfer of moisture from the wood underneath to the wood on top. At the same time, create drainage holes in the materials so water doesn't pool on top.\\n\", 'Build bookends.:  First, begin your row by placing the bottom layer of split wood along the length of the raised bed. Arrange each piece so that all of the cut ends face the same direction. Then, at either end of your row, create a second layer with the cut ends facing the opposite direction. Continue building up both ends of your row by alternating the direction that each layer faces in order to create stable bookends.\\nYou can either build the ends all at once or build them as you go. If you build them all at once, stop once they are approximately four feet (1.2 m) high.\\nUse your \u201cbest\u201d pieces for the bookends. With each piece of wood, check all sides for evenness. Discard any that noticeably tapers from one end to the other. Such pieces may result in a less stable structure.\\nKeep the bark of each piece facing up. Since bark resists moisture, this will help shelter the exposed wood from rainfall.\\n', 'Stack your wood in layers.:  Begin your second layer in between the bookends. Arrange the cut ends so they face the same direction as the bottom layer\u2019s. Set each piece so that it covers two pieces in the bottom layer by straddling where the two bottom pieces meet.\\nPlace each piece with the bark facing up to shelter the exposed wood from rain.\\nUse smaller pieces to fill gaps, when needed, for stability.\\nLeave gaps as they are for better airflow if the layer is strong enough to support the next.\\n', 'Cover if desired.:  Decide whether you are fine with leaving the pile as is or if you want to protect if from rainfall. If you decide to cover it, use black or clear plastic sheeting.\\nDirect contact between the sheeting and wood allows the wood to absorb condensation from the plastic. It also reduces airflow and could result in tears in the plastic due to friction.\\nBlack materials absorb heat and accelerate evaporation.

Over time, however, the well can become contaminated with bacteria and other harmful pathogens.[1]\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n One effective treatment for this is to add chlorine bleach to the well water, which will kill the bacteria. This process takes a day or two, so it's best to prepare yourself for minimal water usage.\\n\\n\", 'steps': ['Know when you need to chlorinate your well.:  It is a good idea to chlorinate your well at least once a year, preferably in the spring. Outside of that, there are several other circumstances under which chlorinating your well becomes necessary:\\nIf your annual water test results show that bacteria is present.\\nIf you notice a change in the color, smell or taste of your drinking water, you should test for bacteria and will need to chlorinate the water if the test comes up positive. You should also determine the water constituent that caused the change in water quality and take measures to treat the water to remove anything unpleasant or unsafe. Your local environmental agency will be able to provide direction in this endeavor.\\nIf the well is new, or has recently undergone repairs, or new pipes have been added.\\nIf the well has been contaminated by flood water, or if the water turns muddy or cloudy after a rainfall.\\nWhen you are preparing to abandon the well or if it is a well that is new to you.\\n', 'Gather the necessary supplies.: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"Calculate the volume of the well.:  In order to determine how much bleach you will need to adequately disinfect your well, you will need to calculate the volume of water it contains. To do this, you will need to multiply the depth of the water column (in feet) by the gallons per linear foot for your well. This depends on the diameter of the well or casing (in inches).\\nTo get the depth of water in your well, you will need to measure the distance from the bottom of the well to the waterline. First, shut off all power for the wellhead at the breaker. Remove the well cap or access the wellhead through the venting opening. Use a strong flashlight to inspect down the casing. Using a fishing line and a moderately heavy weight, drop the line into the water. The line will remain taut until the weight hits the bottom, at which time it will go limp. Once this happens, retrieve the line and measure the wet portion of the string with a tape measure.\\nYou can also mark the line at the top of the well casing and measure the total depth of the well, then subtract the distance from the top of the casing to the surface of the water within the well. This can be found by tying a short stick securely to the line, lowering the stick into the well, marking the line when it goes slack, and measuring the length of the line from the stick to your mark.\\nAlternatively, a rough measurement should be stamped on a plate affixed to the slab poured around the well casing or you can contact the drilling company who constructed the well. They are required to keep records on all of the wells they've worked on in most jurisdictions. You can also check with the State Water Master or Governing Licensing Board of Well Drillers and Pump Installers.\\nThe number of gallons per linear foot is related to the diameter of the well casing. This number should appear on the well log. Drilled wells will usually have a diameter between 4 and 10 inches, whereas bored wells range between 12 and 26. Once you know the diameter of your well, you can use\\nNow that you have measurements for the depth of the water in the well (in feet) and the amount of water per linear foot  in gal\/foot), you can multiply these numbers by each other to get the total volume of water in your well. You will need to use 3 pints of  5% chlorine bleach for every 100 gallons (378.5\\xa0L) of water in your well, plus an extra 3 pints to treat the water in the household plumbing.\\n\", 'Plan on being unable to use the well water for a minimum of 24 hours.:  The process of chlorinating a well takes time, usually one to two days. During this time you will be unable to use water from the well for daily household tasks, so it is important that you plan accordingly. A good time to chlorinate is right before you leave for a weekend getaway or a more lengthy vacation.\\n\\nDuring the chlorination process there is more chlorine in your water supply than a swimming pool, making it unsafe to consume. In addition, if you use too much water, the chlorine will end up in your septic tank and kill the bacteria necessary for decomposing waste.\\nFor these reasons, you will need to use bottled water for drinking and cooking, and refrain from using any sinks or showers. You should also try to keep toilet flushing to a minimum.\\n', 'Turn off the circuit breaker feeding the pump.: ', \"Open the vent or remove the test hole plug.:  Depending on the type of well, you may need to open the vent pipe in order to pour in the chlorine.\\n\\nThe vent pipe should be located on the wellhead, it's usually about 6 inches (15.2\\xa0cm) in length and 1\/2 an inch in diameter. Open the vent by unscrewing the pipe from the seal.\\nAlternatively, you may be able to remove the cover from the top of the well, which may require removing a few screws.\\n\", 'Pour in the bleach.:  Once you have access to the well, carefully pour the correct amount of bleach through a funnel into the access hole, avoiding any electrical connections.\\nYou may want to wear protective gloves, goggles and an apron when handling the undiluted bleach.\\nIf any bleach should get on your skin, rinse it off immediately with clean water.\\n', 'Attach the hose.:  Attach the female end of the hose to the nearest spigot, then run the male end (cut off at an angle) into the hole left by the vent pipe, or directly into the well. \\n\\nIf the hose is not long enough to reach the well, connect additional hoses.\\n', 'Recirculate the water.:  Double-check that all electrical connections are waterproof before turning on the circuit breaker, then the water on at full volume. Leave it to recirculate for at least an hour.\\nThe running water from the hose forces the water at the bottom of the well to flow to the surface, distributing the chlorine evenly.\\nThis ensures that any bacteria in the well water will be exposed to and killed by the chlorine.\\n', 'Test for chlorine.:  After the water has been recirculating for at least an hour, you can test for chlorine in your water supply. You can do this in one of two ways:\\n\\nPull the hose out of the vent and use the chlorine test kit to test for the presence of chlorine in the water coming out of the hose.\\nAlternatively, you can run an outdoor faucet to see if you can detect the smell of chlorine in the water.\\nIf the chlorine test comes up negative, or you cannot smell chlorine in the water supply, continue to recirculate the water for another 15 minutes, then check again.\\n', \"Wash down the sides of the well.:  Once you have detected chlorine in the water, re-insert the hose and vigorously swirl it around to wash any chlorine residue from the well casing and pump piping. Once you've done that for 10 or 15 minutes, turn off the hose and replace well lid or reinsert the vent pipe.\\n\\n\", \"Test for chlorine indoors.:  Go inside and test for the presence of chlorine at every sink bath and shower, using either the test kit or your sense of smell.\\nDon't forget to test both the hot and cold faucets and also remember to run any addition outdoor spigots until chlorine is detected.\\nYou should also flush each toilet in the house once or twice.\\n\", 'Wait 12 to 24 hours.:  Leave the chlorine to sit in the water supply for a minimum of 12 hours, but preferably 24. During this time, do your best to keep water use to a minimum.\\n', \"Set up as many hoses as possible.:  After 24 hours, your water will be completely disinfected and you can begin the process of removing chlorine from your water supply.\\n\\nTo do this, attach as many hoses as you have outdoor spigots and tie the ends around a tree or fence approximately three feet off the ground. This makes it easier to monitor the water flow.\\nDon't run the water anywhere near the septic tank or leach field, as you don't want to expose these areas to the chlorinated water.\\n\", 'Run the water at full force.:  Turn on each of the spigots and run the water as hard as possible. Try to direct the stream of water into a ditch or somewhere the water will be somewhat contained.\\nJust make sure that the ditch does not lead to a stream or pond, as the chlorinated water will kill off fish and other animal and plant life.\\n', 'Test for the presence of chlorine.:  Periodically check the water coming out of the hoses for the presence of chlorine.\\n\\nUse the chlorine test kit for this, as you may be unable to detect small quantities of chlorine by smell alone.\\n', \"Don't allow the well to run dry.:  Boring as it may be, it is important to keep an eye on the water flow at all times, to ensure that the well doesn't run dry.\\n\\nIf the well runs dry, the pump may burn out, and these can be very expensive to replace. If it looks like water pressure is dropping off, turn off power to the pump and wait an hour before resuming the run-off.

Painter's tape will enable you to work freely without having to worry about paint ending up where it doesn't belong.\\nPurchase a 3-4 inch (7.6-10.2 cm) roll of painter's tape if you're worried about making a mess.

When you're done, perform a quick touch test to make sure you haven't missed any wet spots. The frame needs to be completely dry before you move on to sanding.\\n\\nA microfiber towel will be your best bet if you want to work quickly, as they absorb more moisture than regular cotton towels.\\n\", \"Sand the entire frame with a high-grit sandpaper.:  Run the sandpaper lightly over the surface of the frame on all sides. There's no need to be too forceful\u2014the idea is not to actually take off the existing paint, but just to scuff it up enough for the new color to stick. A frame that's already been painted should have a dull appearance by the time you're finished.\\nUnpainted door frames won't typically require sanding. However, giving them a few light sweeps may help improve the paint's ability to adhere.\\nUse 100-grit sandpaper or higher to avoid scraping up the wood underneath the paint.\\nA sanding block with squared edges can come in handy for getting into cracks and crevices that are inaccessible with an ordinary square of sandpaper.\\n\", \"Wipe the frame clean with a damp cloth.:  Go over the frame one more time to pick up any dust or debris generated by sanding. If left behind, it could interfere with the adhesion of the new paint. Once you've got the frame looking spotless, allow it to dry to the touch.\\n\\nYou could also use a clean brush or shop vacuum to remove heavier dust deposits prior to the final wipedown.\\n\", \"Pick out a semi-gloss paint in the desired shade.:  Select a latex-based interior paint designed specifically for use on trim. The slight sheen provided by a glossier paint will better showcase the updated frame by helping it stand out from the walls.\\nIf the door frame you're painting opens to the outside, go with an exterior trim paint instead.\\nLatex-based paints are also easier to maintain than matte and eggshell paints. A quick wipedown with a damp cloth every 2-3 months will ordinarily be enough to keep them clean.\\n\", \"Use a handheld brush.:  You'll be able to paint with greater precision and efficiency with a brush than with a roller, which is best reserved for broad, flat surfaces. Many home improvement experts recommend using a brush with an angled tip to make it easier to work the new color into tight spaces.\\nIn order to achieve the cleanest finish, a good rule of thumb is to use a brush no wider than the surface you're painting.\\nHolding your brush by the metal band just beneath the bristles rather than lower down on the handle will give you even more control over your paint placement.\\n\", \"Start painting in the upper inside corner of the frame.:  Angle the tip of your brush so that it's aligned with the corner and begin moving down the frame with long, sweeping strokes. Continue painting until you reach the bottom of the interior surface, then repeat on the opposite side.\\n\\nTo prevent excess paint from globbing in the corners, work the paint in using the tip of your brush, then gently feather it back out again.\\nPainting with a linear up-and-down motion makes it possible to cover more surface area and use less paint than brushing back and forth widthwise.\\n\", \"Work your way to the outside of the frame.:  After coating the inside of the frame, move outward and paint the jambs, or the outer face that's visible when the door is closed. Once again, go from top to bottom, aiming for full coverage. Don't forget to do both sides.\\nOverlap your strokes by 0.5\u20131 inch (1.3\u20132.5\\xa0cm) to avoid leaving seams or thin patches.\\nKeep an eye out for missed spots, as these may be noticeable to those passing through the door frame.\\n\", 'Paint across the top of the frame.:  Drag your brush from one end of the frame to the other overhead. Be careful not to apply the paint too thick while painting the top of the frame, or it could drip down on you.\\n\\nWhen painting tall door frames with a high clearance, pull up a stepladder so you can work more comfortably and with a better eye for detail.\\n', \"Let the paint dry to the touch before applying a second coat.:  This may take anywhere from 1-4 hours, depending on the type of paint you're using. In the meantime, keep clear of the frame to avoid rubbing off the fresh base coat.\\nPress the pad of your finger into the paint every few hours to see how it's coming along. If it feels slightly tacky, it most likely needs another couple hours.\\n\", \"Brush on additional coats if necessary.:  Most interior frames will only need 1-2 coats to look their best. Exterior frames may benefit from an extra coat to protect them against exposure to the elements. Paint follow-up coats the same way you did the base coat, using long, smooth strokes and moving from the inside out.\\n\\nAfter applying your topcoat, allow it to dry for at least 24 hours. Like you did with the previous coats, perform a touch test so you'll know when it's okay to rehang the door.\\nIt can take up to 2 weeks for new paint to cure completely and become resistant to dirt, smudges, and scratches, but it will be okay to put your door back up after a full day of drying.\\n\", \"Hang the door back up if you removed it.:  Once the paint is dry, replace the door by lining up the 2 sets of hinges and lowering it into place.

Without pruning, oleander can grow up to 10\u201320 feet (3\u20136\\xa0m) tall. Pruning oleander can not only make the plant a more manageable size, it also can force the stems to branch out, which will give your plant a bushier and more attractive shape. Oleanders are strong plants that can tolerate a good amount of pruning, but you should make sure that you prune your oleander in the healthiest way possible for the plant.\\n\\n', 'steps': [\"Prune in late summer or early fall.:  On the whole, oleanders are low-maintenance plants that don't need regular pruning. However, you should aim to do a major pruning of your oleander at least once a year during late summer or early fall. This pruning will help you shape your plant and stimulate healthy growth.\\n\\nPruning at this time won't interfere with the blooming of the plant, because it is after the plant has already bloomed for the season.\\nDon't prune past October. Pruning too late can make the recently cut sections of the plant vulnerable during winter.\\n\", \"Wear gloves.:  It's essential to wear gloves when you are pruning oleander. Oleander is poisonous, and while for the most part it's only dangerous when ingested, it can cause skin irritation and inflammation when handled. That is why it's best to wear gloves when pruning or handling the plant.\\nYou may also consider wearing goggles if you have sensitive skin or eyes.\\nBe aware that the toxin in oleander is primarily in the sap of the plant.\\n\", 'Snip off new shoots at the base of the plant.:  New shoots, also called suckers or basal shoots, are offshoots of the plant that grow up out of the base of the plant. Use sharp gardening shears to snip them as close to the base as you can. You can also dig up the dirt around the shoot and tear them out of the ground to remove them.\\nThese shoots can be harmful to the overall health of the plant because the plant will start to dedicate its energy into maintaining the shoot, rather than investing all its energy in the oleander.\\n', \"Cut oleander stems to about half height you'd like for the overall plant.:  If your oleander is too tall and its size is a problem, you will want to cut it down to size. Since pruning oleander actually encourages growth and branching, cut stems at half the desired height of the plant. For instance, if you'd like your oleander to be four feet tall, cut stems at two feet. Your oleander will continue to grow, and will reach four feet when the branches grow in.\\nIf your plant is more or less the size you'd like, you do not have to do any drastic cuts.\\n\", 'Shape your oleander.:  After cutting the stems to the desired heights, decide if you want to change the overall shape of the plant. When cutting branches, make your cut with sharp gardening shears just above the leaf nodes. The nodes are the sections where three leaves come out from the branch. Cutting just above the nodes encourages flowering.\\nYour plant may have some scraggly or overhanging branches that distract from the natural shape of the plant. Cut these branches to emphasize the natural shape of the plant.\\nYou can also reshape the oleander into more of a tree-shape by cutting off branches near the bottom of the plant, leaving the area around the base clear.\\n', \"Check your plant every month or so for dead growths.:  Apart from your annual pruning, you should also prune here and there when you see dead or damaged branches or blooms. Especially if it's an old plant, or if it's exposed to pests, it will benefit from pruning to remove unhealthy sections.\\n\\n\", \"Put on gloves.:  Even if you're just doing a few minor clips, still wear gloves when you are pruning oleander. Any kind of exposure can cause irritation, so even if you are just clipping a few branches, put on gloves and consider wearing long sleeves in case  you brush up against the oleander.\\n\", 'Look at your oleander plant up close and from all sides.:  Take note of any shoots or stalks that look dead. If it is a young oleander, you may not see any. However, the older and bigger the plant is, the more sections you will see that are past their prime.\\n', \"Snip off damaged branches using sharp gardening shears.:  Use sharp gardening shears to cut off the dead or damaged branches of your oleander. Try to cut them a few inches below where the damaged section begins. If you don't cut off the entire damaged section, the branch won't be able to regrow in a healthy way.\\n\", \"Cut entire damaged stalks close to the roots.:  If the oleander is not only damaged on its branches, but on the whole stalk, cut off the entire stalk. Oleander is an extremely resilient plant, so even cutting off an entire stalk won't hurt the plant. This stalk will regrow eventually, and will be bushier and healthier than ever!\\n\", \"Fertilize the plant after pruning.:  You should aim to fertilize your oleander with a nitrogen fertilizer around one to three times a year, or not at all depending on the fertility of your soil. One of these times should be after your annual pruning of the plant. Your oleander will need the nutrients that fertilizer provides to regrow and blossom.\\nSpread an even layer of fertilizer around the base of the plant. Fertilizer can be found at Home Depot, Lowe's or gardening stores.\\n\", 'Water the oleander.:  You should also water oleander after any pruning. Although oleander is a tough plant that is known for surviving in hot climates, watering the plant evenly can help its regrowth. Make sure not to drench the plant, as this can be more harmful than helpful.\\n', \"Dispose of the cuttings.:  Even just the clippings of oleander can be skin irritants if touched, or potentially harmful if ingested. Make sure to gather all the cuttings in a bag of some kind and dispose of them in a place where pets, children, or others won't be exposed to them.\\nWear your gloves as you collect the clippings.\\nDo not compost any part of the oleander plant.\\n\", \"Wash your tools and your hands.:  After you have finished pruning, wash your gardening shears or any other equipment you used to trim your oleander.\\nWashing your equipment ensures that the next time you use them you won't run the risk of skin irritation from the oleander sap.\\nEven if you wore gloves, make sure to wash your hands as well as any exposed body parts, such as arms or legs.\\n\"], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"use sharp gardening shears","question_type":"['complex']","text_question":"So how gentle should I be when tearing the shoots out?","question_id":"diy-174-3","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-177","question":"I picked a good spot and stuck the pot there.

For best results, put the adenium on a south-facing or west-facing wall.\\n', 'Spray the growing medium with water every other day.:  Adeniums do not require a lot of water, but the seeds should stay moist while germinating. Use a spray bottle to saturate the surface of the potting mixture, being careful not to overwater.\\nThe growing medium should be damp to the touch, but there shouldn\u2019t be standing water on the surface.\\n', 'Watch for sprouts within 7 days.:  Between 7 and 10 days, you should start green sprouts coming out from the soil. Continue to mist the seedlings every other day to keep them lightly covered in water.\\n', 'Move the seedlings to individual pots after 1 month.:  Fill the individual pots with the same potting mixture. Use a transplant tool or a wooden ruler to dig out the seedling, ensuring the root structure stays intact. When replanting, place the adenium 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) higher in the soil so \\nSince adeniums cannot survive in the freezing temperatures of winter, it\u2019s recommended that you keep them in planters or pots so they can easily be moved inside.\\n', 'Cut off a piece of stem 6 inches (15\\xa0cm) long.:  Pick a healthy stem at least 6 inches (15\\xa0cm) long. Use a sharp pair of pruning shears to cut the stem where it where it connects to the trunk.\\nOne pruning session can result in many stems that you can propagate into their own adenium plants!\\n', 'Dry the cutting for 48 hours in a warm, dry place.:  Lay the cut stems on a newspaper or paper towel and keep them out of direct sunlight. Store them in a place that is warm but is not humid. They should be dried out and ready to use within 2 days.\\n', 'Fill a pot with half peat moss and half sand.:  Peat moss and sand create a well-draining planting medium. You can substitute the sand with fine gravel or perlite for a similar effect. Lay a thin layer of gravel on the bottom of the pot so the pot drains more efficiently.\\nYou can use a store-bought mixture meant for cacti or succulents if you do not want to mix your own.\\n', 'Dip the stem in rooting solution and poke it 2 inches (5.1\\xa0cm) into the soil.:  Using a rooting powder or solution will promote the growth of roots from the stem and can be purchased at gardening stores. The cut end of the stem will be what goes in the ground. Bury only 2 inches (5.1\\xa0cm) so the exposed end has a starting point for leaves.\\nPropagated stems will not form an above-ground caudex. The roots will grow underground, but can eventually be exposed after the cutting grows.\\n', 'Mist the stem with a spray bottle every 2 days.:  Keep the planting medium moist, but don\u2019t let it become waterlogged. The planting mixture should feel damp to the touch. When they dry, water them again.\\nWaterlogged adeniums can develop root rot if there is too much water present.\\n', 'Put the pot in a location with 6 hours of indirect sunlight per day.:  The cuttings can be kept indoors or outdoors as long as they stay in a warm and bright place, but keep them out of direct sunlight. As they begin to sprout new leaves, you can begin moving the adeniums into more direct sunlight.\\nIf you keep the adenium indoors, turn the pot 180\u00b0 every 2 days so it will evenly get sunlight.\\n', 'Water the adenium when soil 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) deep is dry to the touch.:  Stick your finger in the dirt to determine if the soil is moist 1 inch (2.5\\xa0cm) deep. If it is not, you should water your adenium. This usually equates to about 1-3 waterings per week, though they can survive droughts without affecting their health.\\nThe more light an adenium gets, the more water it will use.\\n', 'Fertilize adeniums every 2 weeks between April and October.:  When adeniums take in water from the potting mixture, they also pull much of the nutrients. Lay a thin layer of general purpose fertilizer on top of the soil once every 2 weeks so the adenium flourishes.\\n\\nMix the fertilizer at half the recommended strength, and only apply it during the growing season, which is between April and October.\\n', 'Shape the plant with a pair of pruning shears when necessary.:  Adeniums are quick to grow and pruning may be necessary to maintain their shape and health. Prune at the end of the blooming season in early autumn. Use a sharp pair of pruning shears and cut where an unhealthy or unshapely stem connects to the other.\\nSterilized pruning shears will help prevent fungus or rot on the exposed cuts.\\nSave the healthy stems you prune to propagate more adenium plants!\\n', 'Bring adenium indoors when temperatures drop below 32\\xa0\u00b0F (0\\xa0\u00b0C).:  Adeniums are from warm climates, so they will freeze and die if they are left outside.

Then apply a baking soda paste to the tiles and use a stiff bristle brush to scrub away scum, mildew, and grime. Prevent future buildup by drying your tiles four to fives times a week after showering.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Run your shower on a high temperature.:  Let the hot water run for at least 10 minutes. The hot water will open the tile\u2019s pores, making it easier to clean.\\n', 'Mix 1 part vinegar to 1 part water in a bowl.:  Mix the ingredients together in the bowl until they are well-combined. Then fill a spray bottle with the solution.\\n', 'Spray the solution onto your shower tiles.:  Make sure to spray more solution onto dirtier areas, as well as the spaces in between the tiles, i.e., the grout.\\nSince you will be using this solution later on, do not use up all of the solution at this point, or make more solution as you clean.\\n', 'Let the solution set for five minutes.:  This will loosen the soap scum. Depending on how dirty your tiles are, you may need to let the solution set for 30 minutes or longer.\\n', 'Scrub the soap scum.:  Use a stiff bristle brush or a grout brush to do this. This will further loosen the soap scum, making the tiles easier to clean.\\n', 'Rinse with warm water.:  Do this by turning your shower on again. Use a lower temperature setting. However, the water should still be warm.\\nAlternatively, you can use a bucket or a pitcher to rinse the tiles.\\n', 'Mix 3 parts baking soda to 1 part water in a bowl.:  Mix the baking soda and water together until it forms a thick paste. The paste should have a toothpaste-like consistency. If the mixture is thin, then keep adding more baking soda until it reaches the desired thickness.\\nFor tough stains, add hydrogen peroxide to the mix by substituting half of the water with peroxide. You can even add some dish soap.\\nAlternatively, you can use a tile cleaner to clean your tiles if you do not want to use a baking soda paste.\\n', 'Apply the paste with a sponge.:  Do this by spreading the paste over the tiles.\\n', 'Spray the paste with the vinegar solution.:  The vinegar will react with the baking soda, making it bubble. The vinegar helps the paste eat through the soap scum.\\n', 'Scrub your tiles with a scrub brush.:  Use a stiff bristle brush or a grout brush.\\nFor small crevices, use a toothbrush.\\n', 'Rinse with warm water.:  Use a bucket or pitcher to rinse your tiles. Pour the water over the tiles until all the soap and residue are removed.\\n\\nYou may need to rinse your tiles three to five times.\\n', 'Dry the tiles with a clean towel.:  This will prevent water from pooling in corners and crevices, which will help in the prevention of mold and mildew growth.\\n', 'Spray the vinegar solution onto the tiles.:  Do this after you finish showering two to three times a week. This will help keep your shower tiles clean for a longer period of time.\\nKeep a spray bottle labeled \u201cshower spray\u201d in your shower for easy access.

You\u2019ll also want to use only minimal force against the record or you could damage the balance of the platter.\\n', 'Remove debris with canned air.:  You can buy a container of canned air at any office supply store. Follow the cleaning instructions on the can being careful to not get too close to the record. Gently puff air onto the record until the surface appears clean and free of dust. Repeat as necessary.\\nCanned air can sometimes release condensation as well. If this happens, make sure to wipe up any liquids from your record using a clean, soft cloth.\\n', 'Dust with a microfiber cloth.:  Invest in a medium-sized, good quality microfiber cleaning towel. Gently rub this towel in small circles over your record. You can purchase microfiber cloths at most hardware or general home stores. These cloths are good because they will not scratch your record and will pick up dust easily.\\n', 'Use a carbon fiber brush.:  Look for a brush that is made specifically for cleaning records. You can find these at most audio or music stores. Place the brush gently down on top of the record. Start to spin the record slowly, guiding the brush fibers into the grooves. You can also make gentle sweeping motions from the inner to outer rings of the record.\\nIt is a good idea to brush your record first, even if you plan to proceed to a wet cleaning method. Dry brushing will remove some of the particles that could scratch your record if paired with liquid.\\nKeep an eye on your brush and get a new one if the fibers appear bent or aged. Also, keep a brush specifically reserved just for your records.\\n', 'Use a record cleaning arm.:  This is an attachment that sits above the record and gently applies a small cleaning brush to the rotating record. The brush should remove dust, debris, and static from the record all at once. This type of cleaning method can also help to keep your stylus free of dust as well.\\nYou\u2019ll also want to clean the stylus if you notice dust accumulation on it. Stylus cleaner usually comes in a small bottle with an applicator brush or tip.\\n', 'Use a static gun.:  This is a small, plastic gun that cleans your record by removing static electricity from its surface. Follow the directions of the packaging and aim the gun directly at the record without touching. The gun will then neutralize the static electricity, making your record less likely to attract dust.\\nIf your record ever makes a crinkling, crackling, or light crunching noise when being placed in, or pulled out, of its sleeve then it likely needs cleaning by an anti-static device.\\n', 'Use a sticky roller.:  You can buy a roller online, or at a music store, that is specifically designed for record cleaning. Pull the roller along the grooves of the record. It will attract dust to its surface. You can either wash the roller or remove the top layer for a future cleaning.\\nJust make sure that the roller does not leave any residue behind on the record. You may want to do a single test swipe just to make sure.\\n', 'Make your own cleaning solution.:  Get a medium mixing bowl and combine three parts distilled water, one part isopropyl alcohol, and a few drops of dish detergent or dishwasher fluid. Stir these together gently. It is best to use distilled water in order to avoid some of the impurities that can be found in tap water.\\nBe aware that there is some debate over whether or not to use alcohol as part of a cleaning solution for records. The alcohol may strip the record of its surface properties. So, be sure to use with caution and sparingly.\\n', 'Use a prepackaged solution.:  Record stores and music stores often sell cleaners specifically designed for use on audio materials. Check the ingredients of any cleaner that you buy to make sure that you are comfortable with everything included. Make sure to follow the directions closely as well.\\nMake sure to avoid household cleaning products, such as Windex. These cleaners are far too abrasive for records and can destroy the vinyl.\\n', 'Place the record on a cleaning mat.:  You can buy these mats at record stores and they are generally made out of cork or another soft material. If you are worried about using liquids on top of your turntable, then a mat is a good idea. You can place the record flat on the mat and use the attached spindle to hold the record secure.\\nNot all mats are designed for use with liquids. Before you clean with a solution make sure that your mat can handle it.\\n', 'Drizzle the liquid over the record.:  Once you have a solution on hand, gently drizzle a few drops over the surface of the record. Or, moisten a towel with the solution and apply this moisture to the surface of the record. You want the record to be slightly damp, definitely not drenched. Make sure you do not get the liquid on the record label as it can damage the label.\\n', 'Wipe with a microfiber towel.:  Grasp your towel and wipe in a counter-clockwise motion across the record, following the grooves. Be gentle, but apply enough pressure so that the towel makes contact with the interior parts of the groove. Use a totally fresh microfiber cloth to dry the entire record when finished.\\n', 'Use a manual cleaning machine.:  If you are not interested in cleaning your records by hand, then you can invest in a machine to do some of the work for you. There are machines that require special fluids, ones that brush both sides of a disk at once, and ones that combine vacuuming and brushing. Do some research online to find a machine that suits your particular needs.\\n\\nBe aware that some machines can be rather costly with price tags upwards of $500. To save money, look for a machine that uses brushes to clean, instead of vacuums.\\n', 'Keep your records dry.:  Never play or store a wet record. It is a myth that playing a wet record will reduce static build-up. Instead, using a record with moisture on it can damage the grooves and create an even bigger mess to clean. Make sure that you fully wipe down your records with a microfiber cloth or let them air dry on a cleaning mat.\\n', 'Touch them carefully.:  Try to avoid touching the interior grooves of your records whenever possible. Instead, handle them by grabbing the label or perimeter of the disk with your fingertips. The oil on your fingertips can attract dust to the grooves and make it more difficult to clean the record.\\n', 'Place them in archival sleeves.:  When your records are cleaned, place them into fresh interior sleeves. Anti-static plastic sleeves are usually a good option. Look for a sleeve that is labeled as archival quality and non-scratching. This will preserve your disk as you take it in and out to play it.\\n', 'Store them vertically.:  Make sure to place your records vertically next to one another. If you lay them flat, then your risk warping or bending. If your record is leaning to one side, this can also cause bending. So, keep the records placed firmly together with little room in between.\\nStore your vinyl records vertically on shelves to protect them from damage.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Canned air', 'Microfiber cloth', 'Carbon fiber brush', 'Record cleaning arm', 'Static gun', 'Sticky roller', 'Distilled water', 'Isopropyl alcohol', 'Dish detergent', 'Cleaning mat']}","extracted_answer":"vertically next to one another","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"What are the best places to store it?","question_id":"diy-191-8","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"answer_question_recipe_steps"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-196","question":"What should I do after reinstalling the filter?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Clean-a-Grease-Filter","data_split":"train","original_answer":"You should be finished now, Yay!","history":"student: I think it is dry.

Depending on your cooking style and how often you cook, you should clean a residential range hood filter every one to three months. Clean a commercial hood grease filter at least weekly. Many microwaves also have metal grease filters that should be cleaned at least every four months. To clean a grease filter, soak it for ten minutes in a cleaning solution. Scrub it with a soft-bristled brush, and use a toothbrush to get into tight crevices. Rinse, dry, then reinstall it, and enjoy the benefits of a squeaky clean grease filter.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Make sure the appliance is turned off and cool.:  If you\u2019re removing the grease filter from a range hood, make sure the ventilation system is off and the surface is cool to the touch. If it\u2019s cool, any grease deposits will be hardened and easier to remove.\\nSome microwaves also have grease filters. If you\u2019re cleaning a microwave filter, unplug the appliance before removing the filter.\\nNever operate a range or microwave without the grease filter.\\n', 'Remove the metal grease filter.:  A range hood filter might be covered by a plastic casing secured by tabs or screws. However, most filters are easy to remove and require no tools. For some models, simply tilt the filter and lower it out of place.\\nFilters are often secured by a latch that you lift and release.\\nThe filter is located on the back of most microwaves.\\nCheck your appliance\u2019s user manual if you have any trouble finding the grease filter. Be sure to note how you removed the filter so you can easily reinstall it.\\n', 'Use a long handled tool for tall commercial range hoods.:  In commercial kitchens, range hood filters are often so high that it\u2019s necessary to use a ladder to remove them. If you\u2019re a restaurant owner or kitchen manager, you can avoid the hassle and injury risk of using a ladder by investing in a long-handled filter removing tool.\\nYou can find a filter remover online for $50-65 (US).\\n', 'Run the filter through a dishwasher.:  Metal grease filters are dishwasher safe. The dishwasher is a great option if you clean your filter more than once a month or if it\u2019s free of grease deposits. However, if it\u2019s grimy or greasy, you should hand wash the filter to prevent grease from building up in your dishwasher.\\n', 'Create a cleaning solution.:  You can choose between several cleaning solution options, depending on how dirty your filter is and what products you have on hand. The most basic solution is to fill a sink or basin with boiling water, a quarter cup (60 mL) of baking soda, and a tablespoon of degreasing dish detergent.\\n', 'Use a degreaser for stubborn buildup.:  You can also use a degreasing oven cleaner if your filter is especially grimy. If you use a concentrated cleaner, make a solution by mixing it with water. Check the product\u2019s label for a recommended ratio.\\nFor thick, stubborn grease deposits, soak the filter in an auto degreaser.\\nWear rubber gloves when using an oven or auto degreaser.\\n', \"Soak the filter in the cleaning solution for ten minutes.:  Whether you choose a baking soda solution or a degreaser, you should soak the filter for ten minutes. Soaking will help cut through grease deposits and you'll have less scrubbing to do.\\n\", 'Scrub and rinse the filter.:  Use a soft-bristled brush to scrub the filter. You can also use a toothbrush to get into hard to reach crevices. After scrubbing away grease and grime, rinse the filter thoroughly with hot water to remove soap suds and residue.\\n', 'Towel and air dry the filter.:  After you\u2019ve rinsed the filter, shake off excess water. Wipe it down with a clean cloth or paper towels. Let it air dry completely before reinstalling it.\\n', 'Check and replace any fabric or charcoal filters.:  In addition to the metal grease filter, some range hoods include replaceable fabric and activated charcoal filters, which cannot be cleaned. While the metal grease filter is drying, you can check the other filters and see if they need to be replaced.\\nYou should replace a residential range hood\u2019s disposable filters once every three to six months, or when they become noticeable dirty and discolored. You can purchase replacement filters from your model\u2019s manufacturer.\\n', 'Reinstall the metal grease filter.:  You can reinstall the metal filter once it\u2019s completely dry. Slide, latch, or fasten the filter back into the appliance, depending on your model\u2019s design. If your range hood includes a plastic cover, screw or snap it back into place.\\n', 'Consider using disposable fiber grease filters in commercial kitchens.:  While residential grease filters can typically go up to three months without cleaning, grease filters in commercial kitchens need to be cleaned weekly or daily, depending on cooking style and volume. The labor and water costs of frequent cleanings can add up, but you can cut your costs by placing disposable wool filters over your metal hood grease filters.\\n\\nDisposable filters are flame retardant and designed to fit over standard metal baffle filters. They also reduce grease buildup throughout the ventilation duct system.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Large pot (for boiling water)', 'Baking soda', 'Dish detergent', 'Oven degreaser or auto degreaser', 'Non-abrasive scrub brush', 'Toothbrush', 'Cloth or paper towels']}","extracted_answer":"You are done","question_type":"['navigation']","text_question":"What should I do after reinstalling the filter?","question_id":"diy-196-3","intent_question":"request_next_step","intent_answer":"answer_question_external_fact"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-198","question":"Why do I need this specific soap?","domain":"diy","document_url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Clean-a-Fiberglass-Shower-Floor","data_split":"train","original_answer":"The first thing that you need to do is choose a decent cleansing agent and a robust brush.

When you vacuum the baking soda up, the smell of the essential oil should be released.\\n', \"Deodorize with white vinegar.:  Vinegar, like baking soda, can be a great product for deodorizing your carpet because it both absorbs odors and kills odor-causing bacteria. Simply pour some into a spray bottle and then spray a fine mist over your carpet. When the vinegar smell goes away, which may take several hours, you will be left with a deodorized, scent free carpet.\\nIf you don't like the scent of vinegar, keep in mind that the strong smell will dissipate as the vinegar dries. It will not leave a lingering smell.\\n\", 'Use lemon to deodorize.:  If you have a small area or spot that needs to be deodorized, consider using lemon. Mix the juice of one lemon with a few tablespoons of water and then dab it on the offending area. The acidity of the lemon should remove even the most unpleasant odors.\\nOnce you have dabbed the lemon juice mixture on, rinse the area with soapy water and then dry the area with a cloth.\\n', \"Pre-treat stains with baking soda.:  If you have a spill on your carpet that is liquid, you should try to soak up as much of it as you can right away. Whether it's a beverage, urine, food, or other type of liquid, baking soda does a great job of absorbing all kinds of liquid and pulling them out of your carpet.\\nSprinkle baking soda over the stain, making sure that you put enough down to absorb all of the liquid. Give it a few minutes to soak it up.\\nIf you spilled a lot of liquid, it's best to blot away the excess liquid with a towel before you sprinkle baking soda over it.\\n\", 'Apply vinegar and water to stains.:  If you have a simple water-soluble spill, you can use a mixture of vinegar and water to clean it up. Mix a 1\/4 teaspoon of white vinegar with 32 ounces of water in a spray bottle. Spray it on simple spills and then blot the area to remove all the residue. Some spills that this will work on include:\\nBeer\\nCola\\nMilk\\nDirt\\n', 'Use hydrogen peroxide on blood stains.:  Blood stains can be particularly hard to get out of fabrics, including carpets. Hydrogen peroxide can be helpful with removing blood, as it is a natural oxidizer and so it can break blood up. Put some hydrogen peroxide on a clean cloth and dab the area repeatedly. It can take awhile to get the blood out, so take your time and be patient while the hydrogen peroxide does its magic.\\nBe sure to test that the hydrogen peroxide will not damage the carpet fibers on an area of carpet that is not seen before using it in a visible area. If you use hydrogen peroxide, be sure to choose the 3% diluted solution rather than the 6% diluted solution.\\n', 'Apply club soda to acidic stains.:  Club soda will remove many acidic stains, such as coffee, wine, or juice. Simply blot the area with a cloth covered in club soda. Keep adding more club soda to the cloth as it is absorbed into the stained area until the area is relatively saturated.\\nAs the stain is removed, and gets onto the cleaning cloth you are using, use a different area of the cloth to blot, so that the stain is not reapplied to the carpet.\\nOnce the stain is gone, make sure to keep dabbing the area with a dry cloth until the area is dry.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"You are done","question_type":"['navigation']","text_question":"What should I do after dabbing the area with a cloth until dry?","question_id":"diy-210-4","intent_question":"request_next_step","intent_answer":"return_next_step"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-215","question":"I've vacuum all the debris, can you tell me what to do next?

To clean your laminate wood floors without leaving streaks, start by choosing a natural cleaning solution. Apply your solution to the floor using a spray bottle or microfiber mop. Dry your floors right away, making sure to wipe over any footprints that you\u2019ve left behind. Repeat this process every other week for sparkling floors.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Create a vinegar solution.:  Mix together a 50-50 white vinegar and distilled water mixture inside a spray bottle. Shake the bottle a bit before using. If you dislike the smell of vinegar, add in a few drops of an essential oil, such as lemon. This solution can be stored for a number of weeks without losing its cleaning power.\\nIt is possible to use apple cider vinegar in the solution, but this does not have the same sanitizing effect as distilled white vinegar.\\nNatural cleaners have a tendency to leave less residue and create fewer streaks than their commercial counterparts. Although, be aware that premixed cleaning solutions for laminate are available at most home stores.\\n', 'Mix together a tea-based cleaner.:  Boil 1 cup (240\\xa0ml) of black tea using a single tea bag and 1 cup (240\\xa0ml) of water. Wait until the tea cools down and then pour it into a spray bottle for application. Shake the mixture a bit before spraying and use it immediately. Do not store this solution.\\n\\n', 'Use baby shampoo.:  Fill your spray bottle up with warm or room temperature distilled water. Add in 1 tablespoon (15\\xa0ml) of baby shampoo. Shake the bottle until it fills up with bubbles. Spray this solution lightly onto the surface of your floor. Baby shampoo is gentle and safe for most surfaces, including laminate.\\n', 'Remove stains with a baking soda paste.:  Before you do a general cleaning, make sure to address any specific stains or their residue can cause streaking across your finished floor. For a food-based stain, spoon a paste made from baking soda and distilled water over the affected area. Let it sit for a few minutes before wiping it away with a cloth dampened with water.\\n', 'Remove tough stains with rubbing alcohol.:  Applying a bit of rubbing alcohol directly to a stain, using a cotton ball, can also help to remove it. But, don\u2019t let the alcohol sit for too long or it can cause your protective coating to peel up, which can give the appearance of dullness and streaking.\\nTry using an acetone-based nail polish remover as an alternative to rubbing alcohol.\\n', 'Mix everything with distilled water.:  Using tap water is the easier option, but it can add deposits on top of your floor. This, in turn, can make your floor appear dirty or dull. Instead, go with warm or room temperature distilled water in all of your floor cleaning solutions. Using distilled water also makes it possible to store your solution up to a few weeks.\\n\\n', 'Complete a spot test.:  Before you starting the cleaning process, go to a side corner of the room. Apply a bit of your cleaning solution to this space and observe what happens. Look to see if the floor appears dull or otherwise impacted by the solution. If not, proceed as planned. If so, consider using an alternate solution or calling in professional cleaners.\\n', 'Vacuum to remove loose dirt and debris.:  Select the bare floor setting on your vacuum, making sure that the bender bar underneath does not sit directly on the floor\u2019s surface. Follow the grain of your floor and do a few vacuuming passes over the room. Use your vacuum attachment for any corners or crevices. Vacuuming beforehand helps to minimize the movement of dirt and grime on your floor, which can cause streaking.\\n', 'Position yourself facing one wall.:  Stand with your spray bottle or microfiber mop against one of the walls with your back facing the rest of the room. This means that you will spray in front of you when walking backwards. This will keep you from stepping on top of the fresh cleaning solution and leaving footprints or other marks.\\n\\n', 'Apply the cleaner.:  Spray a bit of the cleaning solution onto one of your microfiber mop pads. Or, hold your spray bottle above the floor and lightly mist the surface. Either way, keep an eye on your floor and make sure that it is damp, not soaking wet. Excessive liquid on your floor may cause streaking and warping.\\n', 'Mop the floor using smooth, even movements.:  After you\u2019ve applied the cleaning solution, run your mop over the wet areas, making straight strokes. Keep the amount of pressure that you use even and controlled, or you could end up causing streaking by scrubbing some areas too much and others not enough. Every few minutes, stop and look over the floor to make sure that you are not missing any wet spaces.\\n\\n', 'Dry it right away.:  As soon as you finish applying the cleaning solution, go back to where you began and begin the drying process. Walk backward and use a microfiber cloth or mop pad to pick up the moisture from the floor. Moving this way means that you will minimize your footprints, but make sure to buff them out as you go, leaving a pristine surface behind.\\n', 'Use fresh pads, as needed.:  If you choose to use a microfiber mop, make sure to use a clean pad for the drying stage. Otherwise, you will just apply another layer of dirt onto the clean surface. To keep your pads clean, place them in your washer on a \u201cdelicate\u201d cycle or run them under some warm water.\\n\\nAvoid using a laundry sheet when drying your cleaning cloths or pads, as the chemicals from the sheet can lead to streaking when you use the pads or clothes again.\\n', 'Wipe up any spills immediately.:  If you see a spill on your floor, the most important thing is to get the liquid up quickly. Grab a towel or washcloth and place it on top of the sitting liquid. Replace as needed until the area is no longer damp. Do a final wipe down of the area with a damp cloth.\\n\\n', 'Stick to a cleaning schedule.:  It is possible to clean your floors too much, which can damage the protective coating. It is also possible to clean your floor not often enough, which can lead to the accumulation of dirt and streaking when you do try to clean. Try to mop down your floors every other week or so. Vacuum more frequently to remove any surface debris.\\n', 'Create a \u201cno shoes\u201d rule.:  Start by wearing socks in your own home and asking that guests take off their shoes when entering as well. This will lessen the amount of deep grime present on your floors and it will make it easier to clean them without creating streaks or spots.\\n', 'Call in a professional.:  Locate a floor cleaning professional in your area and then go online to read any reviews that are available. Pay particular attention to the comments regarding the quality of the finished work. If you are concerned about streaking, tell the cleaner about your concerns when you make the appointment.\\n\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Black tea bags', 'Distilled water', 'Vinegar', 'Baking soda', 'Essential oils', 'Dish soap', 'Microfiber cloths', 'Spray bottle', 'Bucket', 'Mop and pads']}","extracted_answer":"apply the cleaner","question_type":"['navigation']","text_question":"I've vacuum all the debris, can you tell me what to do next?

What should be my first step? | teacher: Run your hand along the rug to get the direction of the nap","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Clean a Viscose Rug', 'description': \"\\nViscose rugs are an affordable alternative to natural silk rugs. These carpets are made of a material called rayon and differ from silk rugs in a variety of ways. The rug's fibers are more fragile and require specific care to keep them clean. If you follow the techniques correctly and use cleaning solutions made specifically to clean rayon, you can clean even the dirtiest viscose rug.\\n\\n\", 'steps': [\"Run your hand along the rug to get the direction of the nap.:  The nap or pile is the natural direction that the rug's fibers run. Running your hand across the surface of the rug will give you an indication to how the rug's fibers lay.\\nAgitating the rug against the pile can loosen the rug's fibers and distort your rug.\\n\", \"Push a carpet sweeper in the direction of the nap.:  High power vacuum cleaners and vacuums with beater brushes can damage the fibers in a viscose rug. Instead, use a non-electrical rug or carpet sweeper and run it along the direction of the rug's nap or pile. This should lift up any remaining crumbs or dirt stuck in the rug.\\nYou can go over the rug several times if it's still dirty.\\nYou can find an inexpensive carpet sweeper at many department stores or online. If you don't have a carpet sweeper, you can use a soft broom, such as a window washing broom or hand broom.\\nKeep in mind that viscose is not a strong material. It won't hold up well if you vacuum it often or put it in a high traffic area. When you need to clean it, don't scrub very hard or overwork the fibers.\\n\", 'Sweep the fringes with a broom.:  Do not go over the fringes on the rug with a carpet sweeper or vacuum because you could detach the fringes from the rug. Instead, use a broom or brush and brush the dirt and debris from out of the fringes. Use a dustpan to collect and dispose of the leftover dust.\\n', \"Use a mild dish soap to clean spills.:  Test the dish soap on a small part of the rug before using it. If you notice discoloration or staining, don't use it. If there is a larger area that you need to clean, mild dish soap and water is a good solution. Saturate a rag with cold water and a drop of pH neutral dish soap, then rub the rag in the direction of the nap. When you're done, blot over the area with a dry rag until it's dry.\\nDo not use detergents because they can stain and alter the color in your rug.\\n\", \"Spot clean with white vinegar, water, and dish soap.:  Cleaning spills as soon as they happen will cut down on the size and severity of the stain. For especially tough stains, try spot cleaning the area with a mixture of water, white vinegar, and mild dish soap. Mix the solution together and skim the bubbles on the top of the solution with a rag. Use the rag with the bubbles on it to wipe down the stain then immediately remove the solution with a clean, damp rag.\\nDo not oversaturate the rag in the solution or you may damage your rug.\\nAs an alternative to a vinegar solution, a citric acid solution will also treat stains. Since water can yellow your viscose fibers, you might prefer to use a specialized citric acid solution that won't yellow your viscose.\\nYou can also spray a fabric softener on the rug after spot cleaning it to keep it soft. When you use fabric softener, put it in a spray bottle, then dilute it with water. Spray a little bit of fabric softener onto the rug. Next, use a soft bristle brush to hand groom the rug, brushing it in the direction of the grain.\\n\", \"Limit how often you machine clean your rug.:  Viscose is a weak material, so it can easily get damaged. Using a machine to clean your rug increases the risk of damage, so only do it when the rug is very dirty. It's best to maintain the cleanliness of the rug so you don't have to deep clean it.\\n\", \"Secure the carpet or rug to the floor or a flat surface.:  Use clamps to secure the carpet to a flat surface, or put the carpet on a mounting board so that it doesn't move around as you clean. You can purchase a mounting board at most rug stores or online.\\n\", 'Rent or purchase a carpet cleaning machine.:  You can rent or purchase a carpet cleaning or rug cleaning machine at major home improvement or department stores. These machines come with a hose and cleaning nozzle that transfers and vacuums cleaning solution on your carpet. Rent a machine that uses cold water, because hot water can damage viscose rugs.\\n\\n', \"Mix carpet cleaning chemicals with water to create a cleaning solution.:  You can find anionic detergents or other cleaners made specifically for viscose rugs online or at rug stores. Purchase cleaning chemicals that are made specifically for viscose and read the instructions on the back. Mix the cleaning chemicals with cold water in a bucket before transferring the solution to the basin in your carpet cleaning machine.\\nHot water can shrink your rug.\\nWhen you're finished combining the chemicals, make sure to mix them together so that they become well incorporated.\\n\", \"Drag the head of the carpet cleaning machine across the carpet.:  Pull the trigger on the head of the carpet cleaning machine to eject the cleaning solution into the carpet. Make sure that you go with the nap so that you don't displace any of the fibers of the rug. The dirt and grime in the rug should start coming up.\\nMake sure that you get a carpet cleaner that can wash rugs with cold water, so that you don't shrink your rug.\\n\", \"Use the carpet cleaner to vacuum up the solution.:  Once you've run the carpet cleaner from one end of the rug to the other, go down the same path but this time with only the vacuum running. This should suck up all of the dirty water and dirt from your carpet.\\n\", 'Repeat the steps until the entire carpet is cleaned.:  Continue to go up and down the carpet with the cleaning solution and carpet cleaner until the entirety of the carpet is cleaned.\\n\\n', 'Hang the carpet to dry.:  Flip the carpet over and hang it on a railing to let it to air dry. Do not apply direct heat to the carpet or you could damage it.\\n', \"Get your carpet professionally cleaned if it's in poor condition.:  Viscose rugs are fragile and can be discolored or destroyed very easily. If you own a viscose rug that is important to you personally, consider getting it professionally cleaned rather than doing it yourself. This will ensure that your rug won't be damaged.\\nProfessional carpet cleaners will have the chemicals and tools to clean your viscose carpet.\\n\", \"Blot spills as soon as they happen.:  Use a clean rag or paper towel and blot over the surface of the spill. The faster you're able to blot stains, the less time they will have to seep into the fibers of the carpet. Do not rub or agitate the stain, or you may push the liquid deeper into the carpet.\\n\", 'Keep your rug out of damp areas.:  When viscose rugs are exposed to dampness for a long period, they are easily destroyed. Avoid putting viscose rugs in places like the basement, bathroom, or outside, where they could be exposed to a lot of moisture.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Carpet sweeper', 'Rags', 'Mild dish soap', 'Carpet cleaning machine', 'Carpet cleaning solution', 'Clamps', 'Viscose cleaning solution', 'Water']}","extracted_answer":"run it along the direction of the rugs nap or pile","question_type":"['confirmation']","text_question":"Okay, and you said to sweep in the direction of the nap?","question_id":"diy-220-1","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"ask_student_question"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-223","question":"I have taped the canvas down.

The process is a little time consuming, but it is not difficult as long as you have a sewing machine and some basic sewing skills.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Measure the zipper.:  If a zipper has lost its shape or its teeth are missing, you have to replace the zipper.\\n', 'Choose a zipper that is the same color and style as the old one.:  Along with choosing a zipper of the same length, it is also important to pick a zipper that is the same color and style as the old one. Bring your old zipper with you or take a picture of it to help you find the best match.\\n', 'Shorten the zipper if needed.:  The best way to shorten a zipper is to use a pair of strong scissors to cut across the bottom of the zipper. Identify how much you need to shorten the zipper and then mark your zipper fabric. Cut of the excess zipper by cutting straight across the zipper fabric and teeth.\\nMake sure to install a new zipper pull stop if you shorten the zipper.\\nTo install a new zipper pull stop, push the prongs into the fabric right below the last zipper teeth.\\n', 'Note how the old zipper is positioned before you remove it.:  Before you remove the old zipper, look at how it is sewn into the item.

Insert the long end of the seam ripper into the space between the zipper fabric and item fabric. When you do this, you should notice the thread separate. Keep repeating this with all of the threads holding your zipper in place.\\nA seam ripper is the best tool for removing an old zipper because it allows you to cut the stitches holding the zipper in place without damaging your fabric.

The seam ripper cuts the threads with the sharp area in the middle of the crescent.\\n', 'Pull gently on the zipper fabric as you go.:  To loosen up threads for cutting, make sure to tug gently at the zipper fabric as you go. This will separate the zipper fabric from the item fabric and widen the gap between them. Having more space between the two fabrics will make it easier to get at the threads with your seam ripper.\\n', 'Remove any stray threads.:  After you have cut all of the threads holding the old zipper and your item together, put the zipper aside and then remove the severed threads with your fingers. It is important to clear these away before you sew the new zipper in place or they may get snagged in the sewing machine. \\n', 'Position your new zipper.:  Use your notes on how the old zipper was positioned to help you position the new zipper and then pin it into place.\\nIf you are not sure, then you can attach the zipper in the standard way. Unzip the zipper and then line up the raw edges of one side of the zipper fabric with one side of the item fabric so that the zipper pull is facing towards the item fabric.

An accent wall establishes a focal point in your space, so the wall you choose is important. If you have a fireplace, built-in bookshelves, or some other feature you want to spotlight, use the accent wall to draw eyes straight to it. Consider the room\u2019s purpose, the mood you want to create, and current color scheme before selecting your paint color. When you\u2019re ready to get started on the wall, apply 2 coats of paint for the best results.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Find the natural focal point in the room.:  The focal point of a room is not always the wall you see when you first walk in. Go with the wall that you want to draw attention to because it\u2019s interesting or unique in some way. For example, in a room with a fireplace, accent the fireplace wall. If you have built-in bookshelves, an interesting nook, wainscoting, or something else architecturally distinctive, highlight those elements.\\nIn a bedroom, the wall behind your headboard is a good choice for an accent wall.\\nIf you have a unique sofa, dramatic artwork, or another bold piece in the room, accent the wall behind it.\\n', 'Create a focal point if the room doesn\u2019t have one.:  Think about how you plan to decorate the space and what furniture you have to work with. That way, you can use those elements and the accent wall to create a focal point in the room. If you\u2019re working with a brand new and unfurnished space, the accent wall will determine the color scheme for the rest of the room, so keep that in mind.\\nFor example, if you have a collection of framed family photos you want to hang, showcase them against the backdrop of the accent wall.\\nGorgeous indoor plants can also serve as focal points. If you have a special plant or had your eye on something at the nursery, spotlight it with an accent wall.\\n', \"Go with a solid wall without windows or doors.:  Accent walls look best against solid walls that have no openings, such as windows and doors. If you have large, open windows with a view of beautiful scenery, that wall isn\u2019t necessarily a good wall to accent. The accent color may distract more than accentuate it. Natural light from large windows can also alter how the paint color looks on the wall, and you may not like the results.\\nThis isn't a hard and fast rule, so if you have your heart set on accenting the wall with windows or a door, do it.\\n\", 'Select the farthest short wall in an oblong room.:  If you\u2019re working with a long, skinny room, avoid accenting either of the long walls. The accent color will make them feel even longer, throwing the room off balance. Accenting the farthest short wall will make that wall appear closer to you and balance the oblong shape of the room. Overall, this creates a more proportionate vibe in your space.\\nIf you aren\\'t interested in proportions or if you want to emphasize the length of a room, ignore this advice. These are just basic rules of thumb. You have total artistic freedom, so feel free to break any \"rule\" you want.\\n', \"Favor muted colors over bold ones to stand the test of time.:  Rich, vibrant colors work well for accent walls, but if you\u2019re leaning toward a particularly bold statement color, like fire engine red, think carefully before you take the plunge. This is especially true if the color you\u2019re considering is a current trend. Trends come and go, and in the long run you\u2019ll probably be happier with something more neutral.\\nColor trends like bright purple and aqua don't have to be avoided completely! If you're considering a bold or unusual color, consider a slightly muted shade of that color.\\nIf you don\u2019t mind painting the room again when you\u2019re over the statement color, then you should go for it. If you don\u2019t want to paint again in a year or 2, opt for a muted shade.\\n\", 'Account for the room\u2019s purpose and the mood you want to create.:  Different colors convey different energies, and these energies can have a significant effect on some people. If you\u2019re painting a bedroom, for instance, a red accent wall might be jarring or make it difficult to fall asleep. A color like cerulean blue, which is still a vibrant hue, may create a more calming atmosphere.\\nIn a room where you want to create energy, like a den or playroom, vibrant options like lime or chartreuse work well. A bathroom might benefit from a calmer green, like seafoam green.\\nThe temperature of the color plays a role, too. Warm colors like red and orange create a different vibe than cool tones like green, blue, and purple.\\n', 'Go with a color that is darker than the other walls in the room.:  A darker hue will contrast with the lighter walls and pull eyes straight to it, which is what you want. A good rule of thumb is to paint the accent wall the same color as the other walls, but 2 shades darker. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable going wild with color choice and placement, this route tends to be foolproof.\\nYou don\u2019t have to do this. A light accent wall in a darker room can work, but it\u2019s riskier. When the focal point in the room is lighter than the wall across from it, the room may feel off balance or disorienting.\\n', 'Choose a color that complements the room\u2019s color scheme.:  This may seem like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s extremely important! The accent wall must work with your existing d\u00e9cor, and the best way to connect it is by replicating a color from the current color scheme. Secondary colors (rather than the main color) in your current color scheme are usually a great choice for accent walls.\\nFor example, the color of your throw pillows or in the pattern of the sofa fabric would work well. A color that pops up frequently in your wall art is another strong choice.\\nIf your current decor consists of a navy blue couch with forest green pinstripes, forest green throw pillows, navy blue curtains and a small green rug, consider using green for your accent wall.\\n', 'Avoid color coordinating everything in the room.:  Don\u2019t use the dominant color in your color scheme for your accent wall. Everything in the room will match too much and nothing will stand out, making your accent wall a bit anti-climactic. For the best results, be sure to choose a color that contrasts with the dominant color in the room.\\nFor example, if you have navy blue curtains and upholstery, don\u2019t use that color for your accent wall. All that navy will end up being a bit drab.\\n', \"Calculate how much paint you\u2019ll need.:  Multiply the total width of the accent wall by the height of your ceiling. This tells you the square footage of the accent wall. Typically, 1 gallon (3.8\\xa0L) of paint covers around 350 to 400 square feet. Divide your total square footage by 350 or 400 to figure out how many gallons of paint you\u2019ll need to cover the wall. A single gallon is enough for most walls, but keep in mind you\u2019ll probably need to do 2 coats.\\nIf there are windows on the accent wall, subtract 15 square feet from your total square footage. Then divide that number by 350 or 400.\\nIf there's a door, subtract 21 square feet before dividing by 350 or 400.\\n\", 'Remove the fixtures on the wall and put down protective tarp.:  Take off the outlet covers, fixtures, switch plates, and window coverings before you get started. Use painter\u2019s tape to mask off the window sills, door hinges, baseboards, etc. Protect the floor with a tarp and cover any furniture in the room. Crack a window or get a fan so that the room stays ventilated.\\n', \"Use painter's tape to create clean lines on the adjoining walls.:  Since the color of the accent wall will contrast quite a bit with the ceiling and other adjoining walls, it\u2019s important to get a straight, clean line where the accent wall meets them. Crooked or smudged lines will be very noticeable. Apply the tape slowly and be precise for best results.\\n\", 'Clean the wall before you paint.:  Dirt and debris will prevent the paint from adhering well to the wall, so always clean interior walls before you paint them. Create a mild cleaning solution with warm water and a few drops of dish detergent. Wipe the wall down with a sponge or cloth, working from floor to ceiling and in small sections. Let the wall dry completely before moving on.\\n', 'Brush on a coat of primer for the best paint coverage (if desired).:  Primer isn\u2019t required, but it\u2019s recommended. It will help the paint adhere to the wall, allow for better coverage, and help the paint wear better over time. Buy an indoor paint primer and apply one coat to the accent wall with a roller or paintbrush. Let it dry completely before you start painting.\\n', 'Apply 2 coats of your chosen paint for the best finish.:  Use a latex-based interior paint for this job. Start applying paint in one of the top corners, working from the ceiling to the floor in small sections. Use an angled brush to get into the corners, then switch to a roller to cover the main wall space faster. Use the angled brush anywhere you need to do detail work.\\nWait for the first coat to dry, then apply a second coat the exact same way.\\nLet the last coat of paint dry completely before removing the painter\u2019s tape and replacing fixtures.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"favor muted colors over bold ones to stand the test of time","question_type":"['complex']","text_question":"I want the room to give off an air of sophistication and taste.

If you have a fireplace, built-in bookshelves, or some other feature you want to spotlight, use the accent wall to draw eyes straight to it. Consider the room\u2019s purpose, the mood you want to create, and current color scheme before selecting your paint color. When you\u2019re ready to get started on the wall, apply 2 coats of paint for the best results.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Find the natural focal point in the room.:  The focal point of a room is not always the wall you see when you first walk in. Go with the wall that you want to draw attention to because it\u2019s interesting or unique in some way. For example, in a room with a fireplace, accent the fireplace wall. If you have built-in bookshelves, an interesting nook, wainscoting, or something else architecturally distinctive, highlight those elements.\\nIn a bedroom, the wall behind your headboard is a good choice for an accent wall.\\nIf you have a unique sofa, dramatic artwork, or another bold piece in the room, accent the wall behind it.\\n', 'Create a focal point if the room doesn\u2019t have one.:  Think about how you plan to decorate the space and what furniture you have to work with. That way, you can use those elements and the accent wall to create a focal point in the room. If you\u2019re working with a brand new and unfurnished space, the accent wall will determine the color scheme for the rest of the room, so keep that in mind.\\nFor example, if you have a collection of framed family photos you want to hang, showcase them against the backdrop of the accent wall.\\nGorgeous indoor plants can also serve as focal points. If you have a special plant or had your eye on something at the nursery, spotlight it with an accent wall.\\n', \"Go with a solid wall without windows or doors.:  Accent walls look best against solid walls that have no openings, such as windows and doors. If you have large, open windows with a view of beautiful scenery, that wall isn\u2019t necessarily a good wall to accent. The accent color may distract more than accentuate it. Natural light from large windows can also alter how the paint color looks on the wall, and you may not like the results.\\nThis isn't a hard and fast rule, so if you have your heart set on accenting the wall with windows or a door, do it.\\n\", 'Select the farthest short wall in an oblong room.:  If you\u2019re working with a long, skinny room, avoid accenting either of the long walls. The accent color will make them feel even longer, throwing the room off balance. Accenting the farthest short wall will make that wall appear closer to you and balance the oblong shape of the room. Overall, this creates a more proportionate vibe in your space.\\nIf you aren\\'t interested in proportions or if you want to emphasize the length of a room, ignore this advice. These are just basic rules of thumb. You have total artistic freedom, so feel free to break any \"rule\" you want.\\n', \"Favor muted colors over bold ones to stand the test of time.:  Rich, vibrant colors work well for accent walls, but if you\u2019re leaning toward a particularly bold statement color, like fire engine red, think carefully before you take the plunge. This is especially true if the color you\u2019re considering is a current trend. Trends come and go, and in the long run you\u2019ll probably be happier with something more neutral.\\nColor trends like bright purple and aqua don't have to be avoided completely! If you're considering a bold or unusual color, consider a slightly muted shade of that color.\\nIf you don\u2019t mind painting the room again when you\u2019re over the statement color, then you should go for it. If you don\u2019t want to paint again in a year or 2, opt for a muted shade.\\n\", 'Account for the room\u2019s purpose and the mood you want to create.:  Different colors convey different energies, and these energies can have a significant effect on some people. If you\u2019re painting a bedroom, for instance, a red accent wall might be jarring or make it difficult to fall asleep. A color like cerulean blue, which is still a vibrant hue, may create a more calming atmosphere.\\nIn a room where you want to create energy, like a den or playroom, vibrant options like lime or chartreuse work well. A bathroom might benefit from a calmer green, like seafoam green.\\nThe temperature of the color plays a role, too. Warm colors like red and orange create a different vibe than cool tones like green, blue, and purple.\\n', 'Go with a color that is darker than the other walls in the room.:  A darker hue will contrast with the lighter walls and pull eyes straight to it, which is what you want. A good rule of thumb is to paint the accent wall the same color as the other walls, but 2 shades darker. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable going wild with color choice and placement, this route tends to be foolproof.\\nYou don\u2019t have to do this. A light accent wall in a darker room can work, but it\u2019s riskier. When the focal point in the room is lighter than the wall across from it, the room may feel off balance or disorienting.\\n', 'Choose a color that complements the room\u2019s color scheme.:  This may seem like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s extremely important! The accent wall must work with your existing d\u00e9cor, and the best way to connect it is by replicating a color from the current color scheme. Secondary colors (rather than the main color) in your current color scheme are usually a great choice for accent walls.\\nFor example, the color of your throw pillows or in the pattern of the sofa fabric would work well. A color that pops up frequently in your wall art is another strong choice.\\nIf your current decor consists of a navy blue couch with forest green pinstripes, forest green throw pillows, navy blue curtains and a small green rug, consider using green for your accent wall.\\n', 'Avoid color coordinating everything in the room.:  Don\u2019t use the dominant color in your color scheme for your accent wall. Everything in the room will match too much and nothing will stand out, making your accent wall a bit anti-climactic. For the best results, be sure to choose a color that contrasts with the dominant color in the room.\\nFor example, if you have navy blue curtains and upholstery, don\u2019t use that color for your accent wall. All that navy will end up being a bit drab.\\n', \"Calculate how much paint you\u2019ll need.:  Multiply the total width of the accent wall by the height of your ceiling. This tells you the square footage of the accent wall. Typically, 1 gallon (3.8\\xa0L) of paint covers around 350 to 400 square feet. Divide your total square footage by 350 or 400 to figure out how many gallons of paint you\u2019ll need to cover the wall. A single gallon is enough for most walls, but keep in mind you\u2019ll probably need to do 2 coats.\\nIf there are windows on the accent wall, subtract 15 square feet from your total square footage. Then divide that number by 350 or 400.\\nIf there's a door, subtract 21 square feet before dividing by 350 or 400.\\n\", 'Remove the fixtures on the wall and put down protective tarp.:  Take off the outlet covers, fixtures, switch plates, and window coverings before you get started. Use painter\u2019s tape to mask off the window sills, door hinges, baseboards, etc. Protect the floor with a tarp and cover any furniture in the room. Crack a window or get a fan so that the room stays ventilated.\\n', \"Use painter's tape to create clean lines on the adjoining walls.:  Since the color of the accent wall will contrast quite a bit with the ceiling and other adjoining walls, it\u2019s important to get a straight, clean line where the accent wall meets them. Crooked or smudged lines will be very noticeable. Apply the tape slowly and be precise for best results.\\n\", 'Clean the wall before you paint.:  Dirt and debris will prevent the paint from adhering well to the wall, so always clean interior walls before you paint them. Create a mild cleaning solution with warm water and a few drops of dish detergent. Wipe the wall down with a sponge or cloth, working from floor to ceiling and in small sections. Let the wall dry completely before moving on.\\n', 'Brush on a coat of primer for the best paint coverage (if desired).:  Primer isn\u2019t required, but it\u2019s recommended. It will help the paint adhere to the wall, allow for better coverage, and help the paint wear better over time. Buy an indoor paint primer and apply one coat to the accent wall with a roller or paintbrush. Let it dry completely before you start painting.\\n', 'Apply 2 coats of your chosen paint for the best finish.:  Use a latex-based interior paint for this job. Start applying paint in one of the top corners, working from the ceiling to the floor in small sections. Use an angled brush to get into the corners, then switch to a roller to cover the main wall space faster. Use the angled brush anywhere you need to do detail work.\\nWait for the first coat to dry, then apply a second coat the exact same way.\\nLet the last coat of paint dry completely before removing the painter\u2019s tape and replacing fixtures.\\n'], 'ingredients': []}","extracted_answer":"apply the tape slowly and be precise for best results","question_type":"['causal']","text_question":"How do i make sure i make the tape nice and straight when applying on wall?

","task_data":"{'title': 'How to Grow Portobello Mushrooms', 'description': '\\nFresh portobello mushrooms are easier to grow than you may think. To make the process as simple as possible, purchase a growing kit. Otherwise, assemble a planting bed and plant portobello spores in it. Whether you choose to grow the mushrooms indoors or outdoors, keep the soil damp and at the appropriate temperature. Soon, you will have tasty mushrooms to add to a hamburger or chop up into a salad.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Build a tray frame out of scrap wood.:  Pick up some scrap wood from a lumberyard or purchase boards from a home improvement store. The frame should be about 8\\xa0in (20\\xa0cm) deep and at least 6\\xa0in (15\\xa0cm) long. Nail the wood together to form the bed.\\nInstead of assembling a tray, purchase a mushroom-growing kit from a gardening store or online. It includes all the components you need for growing mushrooms.\\n', 'Fill the bed with manure-based compost.:  Purchase a bag of compost from a gardening center, then pour it into the bed until it is 6\\xa0in (15\\xa0cm) deep. Avoid filling up the tray so you have space to mix the soil and add peat moss later.\\nThe manure mixed in is dried, so it shouldn\u2019t stink up your house. However, you may try other organic compost products in place of manure-based compost.\\n', \"Cover the bed with black plastic when growing portobellos outdoors.:  To sterilize the soil, lay a piece of cardboard over the compost. Cover the cardboard with a single layer of black plastic sheeting, which you can find at a general store or home improvement store. Make sure it\u2019s tight inside the bed and won\u2019t get blown away by the wind.\\nIf you chose to grow your portobellos indoors, sterilizing the soil likely won't be necessary. You can still do it if you wish to ensure that your mushrooms grow big and healthy.\\n\", 'Leave the bed in the sunlight for 2 weeks when growing outdoors.:  Leave the plastic in place and let the bed sit out in the sun. The sunlight will pass through the plastic and cardboard, clearing the compost of harmful bacteria that can damage the mushrooms.\\n', 'Place the bed in a dark room to grow portobellos indoors.:  Put the tray in a dark corner of a shed, closet, basement, or another suitable area. The dark room should be kept between 50 to 70\\xa0\u00b0F (10 to 21\\xa0\u00b0C). Because you\u2019re working indoors, the temperature most likely won\u2019t need to be adjusted.\\n\\n', 'Move the bed to a climate-controlled area for outdoors growing.:  For the mushrooms to grow, the temperature needs to be no higher than 70\\xa0\u00b0F (21\\xa0\u00b0C) in the daytime and no lower than 50\\xa0\u00b0F (10\\xa0\u00b0C) at night. If the temperature goes beyond this, you may need to move the bed to a safer location, such as in shade or indoors.\\nA dark area, such as in the shade of a tree, also helps, but it\u2019s most important to get the temperature right.\\nYou can monitor the soil by placing a soil thermometer in the bed.\\nMushrooms do well in water, so rain falling on your planting bed is okay.\\n', 'Mix the mushroom spores into the compost.:  Mushroom spores can be purchased online and may also be found at some gardening stores. Once you have them, put on a pair of rubber gloves. Sprinkle the spores onto the compost, then gently mix them in about 1\\xa0in (2.5\\xa0cm). Press down on the compost when you\u2019re finished.\\nFirst, remove the plastic and cardboard if you used it to sterilize the soil.\\n', 'Cover the compost with peat moss and newspaper.:  Get some peat moss from a garden center or home improvement store. Spread a 1\\xa0in (2.5\\xa0cm) layer over the compost. Then spread a single layer of newspaper over the peat moss.\\n', 'Mist the newspaper daily to keep it moist.:  Use a spray bottle at least once a day to keep the newspaper wet. If it looks dry, spray it to keep up the humidity level in the bed. Mushrooms thrive in damp environments, so it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll supply too much water by misting.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re growing outdoors, increase misting to twice a day to ensure the bed doesn\u2019t dry out.\\n', 'Remove the newspaper in 2 weeks if the mushrooms are growing.:  After the 2 weeks are up, lift up the newspaper. Look for tiny, white heads coming out of the peat moss. If they\u2019re there, leave the newspaper off.\\nYou may see white streaks in the soil, which means the mushrooms are taking root. Leave the newspaper in place and continue misting for another week.\\n', 'Continue misting the mushrooms as they grow.:  Mist the peat moss every day so water continues to drip into the bed. After about 10 days, the mushrooms will be fully-grown, although you can harvest the mushrooms sooner if you wish.\\n\\n', 'Dig out the portobellos when the caps have fully unfurled.:  Portobellos reach their peak when the mushroom caps are about 4 to 6\\xa0cm (1.6 to 2.4\\xa0in) in diameter. Dig them out of the compost by hand, then clean them off with a damp paper towel and store them in a brown paper bag in the refrigerator.\\nHarvesting the mushrooms early means you\u2019ll be eating brown criminis instead of portobellos. Wait until the edges of the caps are flat instead of curled.\\n', 'Repeat moistening the compost until new mushrooms form.:  Keep your tray with compost intact for now. Continue moistening the compost daily, then add a new layer of newspaper once white streaks form again. By following the same steps, you will usually get 2 or 3 batches of mushrooms out of 1 tray.\\n'], 'ingredients': ['Shady, temperature-controlled growing area', 'Wood or another growing container', 'Nails', 'Manure-based compost', 'Peat moss', 'Newspaper', 'Spray bottle', 'Cardboard', 'Black plastic sheet']}","extracted_answer":"dig them out of the compost by hand","question_type":"['factoid']","text_question":"What do I use to dig the mushrooms out, a shovel, or my hands so that I don't damage them?","question_id":"diy-246-7","intent_question":"ask_question_recipe_steps","intent_answer":"return_next_step"},{"conversation_id":"Wizard-of-Task-diy-248","question":"Great, i have most of this.

Luckily, there are many things that you can do to keep them out of your bed, and even out of your living space entirely.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Look for potential entry points to your bedroom.:  Take a few minutes to search your entire bedroom for places where roaches could potentially get in from outside. Take a close look at where the walls meet the floor and ceiling in your room, the corners, the air vents, and around the windows.\\n\\nKeep in mind that roaches can slip through cracks and holes that are as small as 3 millimetres (0.12\\xa0in) high.\\n', 'Seal up the cracks with a caulking gun.:  Purchase a simple caulking gun from your local home improvement store. The gun should come with directions, so read them over carefully before attempting to use it. If you find any cracks that you think roaches could slip through in your bedroom, hold the nozzle of the caulking gun up to the crack and move it across the crack as you pull the trigger and fill the crack with caulk.\\n\\nAllow the caulk to dry for as long as the product recommends.\\nCockroaches can wedge themselves into spaces that are only 1\u20132 millimetres (0.039\u20130.079\\xa0in) thicker than they are.\\n', 'Check your vent screens and replace them if necessary.:  The only thing really blocking entry through air vents in your bedroom is vent screens. If you find that there are any holes in any of the vent screens in your bedroom, replace them as soon as possible.\\n\\nIf you find a very small hole or just want a temporary fix, you can cover the hole with 1-2 layers of heavy duty tape, such as Duct Tape.\\n', 'Install weather strips on your doors.:  While your bedroom door probably just opens up to the rest of the inside of the home, roaches that get in through other doors of the home can make their way to your bedroom and even your bed. Install weather strips on all of the doors that open to the outside to keep roaches from slipping into your home through the spaces between the door and the door frame.\\n', 'Get rid of any bedding that\u2019s dragging on the ground.:  If you struggle to keep the roaches from getting into your home and bedroom, you may still be able to keep them out of your bed. Tuck in your sheets and swap out oversized comforters for smaller ones that don\u2019t brush your bedroom floor. This should make it harder for roaches to climb up into your bed.\\n\\nRoaches may be able to crawl up bed skirts as well. If you have one, take it off of your bed and put it away.\\n', 'Wrap silicone tape around the bottom of your bed posts.:  Purchase non-tacky rubber silicone tape at a hardware store or online. Wrap the tape around each of your bed posts from just underneath your box spring to where each post meets the floor. This should also help keep roaches from climbing into your bed if they happen to get inside your home. \\n\\n', 'Throw out and put away clutter.:  Roaches are drawn to clutter, as it gives them somewhere to hide and live without being exposed or disturbed. Divide up the clutter in your bedroom into \u201cthrow away\u201d and \u201ckeep\u201d piles. Then, toss out the items in the \u201cthrow away\u201d pile and put away the items in the \u201ckeep\u201d pile.\\n\\nRoaches are especially drawn to cardboard and newspaper, so get rid of any newspaper and\/or switch out any cardboard boxes for plastic storage containers.\\nTry to keep dirty laundry in your laundry basket and clean laundry folded in your dresser or hung up in your closet.\\nRemove any wallpaper, shelf liners as they eat the paste on the back of it.\\n', \"Keep your room and home clean.:  Roaches thrive in dirty environments, so it\u2019s very important that you regularly clean your bedroom, and also the rest of your home. Sweep, mop, vacuum, dust, and wipe down surfaces with multipurpose cleaner and a rag once a week or so. Also, it\u2019s crucial that you stay on top of doing the dishes and taking out the trash. Roaches love food, so full kitchen sinks and trash cans may draw them into your home.\\n\\nRemove anything with glue, starch, soap, fabrics, wood as well, and sources of water, as they've got a very wide appetite.\\nIf possible, keep food out of your bedroom completely. If you must store some in your room, keep all of it in tightly sealed boxes or bags.\\nMake sure the seal on the fridge door is in good shape, as the younger ones can get inside.\\n\", 'Clean up debris in your yard.:  If you extend the inhospitable environment to the outside of your home as well, roaches will be much less likely to get into your home, bedroom, and ultimately, your bed. Roaches like to spend time underneath messy wood piles and dead leaves. Rake up any dead leaves and dispose of them, and organize and clean up any woodpiles you have in your yard, especially if they\u2019re kept close to your home.\\n', 'Spray cypress and peppermint oils under and around your bed.:  These essential oils tend to naturally repel roaches. Mix 8 drops of cypress oil, 10 drops of peppermint oil, and 1 cup (240\\xa0ml) of water in a spray bottle and then spray this mixture wherever you\u2019ve seen roaches. When in doubt, spray underneath and around your bed.\\n\\n', 'Repel roaches with coffee grounds.:  Because coffee can be harmful to roaches, they tend to stay away from it. Sprinkle some coffee grounds into a few different open containers and set them under or near your bed to deter roaches.\\nCoffee grounds can effectively repel other insects as well, such as ants, due to the caffeine they contain.\\n', 'Use cigar clippings to ward off roaches.:  The nicotine in cigars acts as a repellent for roaches.

Luckily, there are many things that you can do to keep them out of your bed, and even out of your living space entirely.\\n\\n', 'steps': ['Look for potential entry points to your bedroom.:  Take a few minutes to search your entire bedroom for places where roaches could potentially get in from outside. Take a close look at where the walls meet the floor and ceiling in your room, the corners, the air vents, and around the windows.\\n\\nKeep in mind that roaches can slip through cracks and holes that are as small as 3 millimetres (0.12\\xa0in) high.\\n', 'Seal up the cracks with a caulking gun.:  Purchase a simple caulking gun from your local home improvement store. The gun should come with directions, so read them over carefully before attempting to use it. If you find any cracks that you think roaches could slip through in your bedroom, hold the nozzle of the caulking gun up to the crack and move it across the crack as you pull the trigger and fill the crack with caulk.\\n\\nAllow the caulk to dry for as long as the product recommends.\\nCockroaches can wedge themselves into spaces that are only 1\u20132 millimetres (0.039\u20130.079\\xa0in) thicker than they are.\\n', 'Check your vent screens and replace them if necessary.:  The only thing really blocking entry through air vents in your bedroom is vent screens. If you find that there are any holes in any of the vent screens in your bedroom, replace them as soon as possible.\\n\\nIf you find a very small hole or just want a temporary fix, you can cover the hole with 1-2 layers of heavy duty tape, such as Duct Tape.\\n', 'Install weather strips on your doors.:  While your bedroom door probably just opens up to the rest of the inside of the home, roaches that get in through other doors of the home can make their way to your bedroom and even your bed. Install weather strips on all of the doors that open to the outside to keep roaches from slipping into your home through the spaces between the door and the door frame.\\n', 'Get rid of any bedding that\u2019s dragging on the ground.:  If you struggle to keep the roaches from getting into your home and bedroom, you may still be able to keep them out of your bed. Tuck in your sheets and swap out oversized comforters for smaller ones that don\u2019t brush your bedroom floor. This should make it harder for roaches to climb up into your bed.\\n\\nRoaches may be able to crawl up bed skirts as well. If you have one, take it off of your bed and put it away.\\n', 'Wrap silicone tape around the bottom of your bed posts.:  Purchase non-tacky rubber silicone tape at a hardware store or online. Wrap the tape around each of your bed posts from just underneath your box spring to where each post meets the floor. This should also help keep roaches from climbing into your bed if they happen to get inside your home. \\n\\n', 'Throw out and put away clutter.:  Roaches are drawn to clutter, as it gives them somewhere to hide and live without being exposed or disturbed. Divide up the clutter in your bedroom into \u201cthrow away\u201d and \u201ckeep\u201d piles. Then, toss out the items in the \u201cthrow away\u201d pile and put away the items in the \u201ckeep\u201d pile.\\n\\nRoaches are especially drawn to cardboard and newspaper, so get rid of any newspaper and\/or switch out any cardboard boxes for plastic storage containers.\\nTry to keep dirty laundry in your laundry basket and clean laundry folded in your dresser or hung up in your closet.\\nRemove any wallpaper, shelf liners as they eat the paste on the back of it.\\n', \"Keep your room and home clean.:  Roaches thrive in dirty environments, so it\u2019s very important that you regularly clean your bedroom, and also the rest of your home. Sweep, mop, vacuum, dust, and wipe down surfaces with multipurpose cleaner and a rag once a week or so. Also, it\u2019s crucial that you stay on top of doing the dishes and taking out the trash. Roaches love food, so full kitchen sinks and trash cans may draw them into your home.\\n\\nRemove anything with glue, starch, soap, fabrics, wood as well, and sources of water, as they've got a very wide appetite.\\nIf possible, keep food out of your bedroom completely. If you must store some in your room, keep all of it in tightly sealed boxes or bags.\\nMake sure the seal on the fridge door is in good shape, as the younger ones can get inside.\\n\", 'Clean up debris in your yard.:  If you extend the inhospitable environment to the outside of your home as well, roaches will be much less likely to get into your home, bedroom, and ultimately, your bed. Roaches like to spend time underneath messy wood piles and dead leaves. Rake up any dead leaves and dispose of them, and organize and clean up any woodpiles you have in your yard, especially if they\u2019re kept close to your home.\\n', 'Spray cypress and peppermint oils under and around your bed.:  These essential oils tend to naturally repel roaches. Mix 8 drops of cypress oil, 10 drops of peppermint oil, and 1 cup (240\\xa0ml) of water in a spray bottle and then spray this mixture wherever you\u2019ve seen roaches. When in doubt, spray underneath and around your bed.\\n\\n', 'Repel roaches with coffee grounds.:  Because coffee can be harmful to roaches, they tend to stay away from it. Sprinkle some coffee grounds into a few different open containers and set them under or near your bed to deter roaches.\\nCoffee grounds can effectively repel other insects as well, such as ants, due to the caffeine they contain.\\n', 'Use cigar clippings to ward off roaches.:  The nicotine in cigars acts as a repellent for roaches. If you or someone you know smokes cigars, collect the clippings, sprinkle them in a few  containers without putting the lids on, and set them on the floor near your bed to help keep roaches away.\\n', 'Crush up and spread around some bay leaves as an alternative.:  Bay leaves also act a natural roach repellent, as roaches hate the smell of them. Use a mortar and pestle or any other crushing tools to turn some bay leaves into a powder.

They create a route for stray electricity, which occurs during a short or other malfunction, to have an efficient route out of a building. To begin installation, you need to find an appropriate location to install them and then drive them into the ground. Once the rods are in the ground, then you need to ensure that they are connected to the electrical system they are grounding correctly. With a bit of planning and care, you can install grounding rods for a new electrical panel or for an existing panel in order to minimize the threat of electrical fire and injury.[1]\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'steps': [\"Install the rod in a location near the electrical panel.:  Ground rods need to be installed in the ground outside in a spot where they can be hammered 8 feet (2.4\\xa0m) into the ground. There is no requirement for how close or far from a building they should go, but be sure to pick a spot that is convenient to get to and where you will have space to use tools to drive the rod into the ground.\\nIf a grounding rod is too close to a building foundation, it could interfere with it. Because of this, it's best to keep it at least 2 feet (0.61\\xa0m) from the side of the building.\\n\", \"Plan the route for the grounding electrode conductor.:  Once a ground rod is driven into the ground, it will need to be connected to the electrical panel inside. This is done with a wire called the grounding electrode conductor. It's important to factor its route in when picking a spot for the ground rod. Make sure the grounding cable can easily be routed to the panel from where the grounding rod is positioned.\\nIf you have an idea of where you would like to\\n\", 'Avoid locations where the ground is mostly rock or heavily compacted.:  Because you have to drive the rod 8 feet (2.4\\xa0m) into the ground, you want to avoid areas that are excessively rocky. While you wont always be able to avoid rocks or know they are there, avoid picking an area that you know is full of rocks.\\n\\n', 'Locate any wires or pipes in the path of the ground rod.:  Once you have picked a spot to put your ground rod, you need to make sure you will not damage anything in the ground when you install it. In many countries, there are hotlines you can call to have your utilities located free of charge. In the US, for example, there is a national hotline that you can call in order to notify your utilities that you need a locator.\\nIt usually takes about 2-3 days for the utilities to come and do the locating, so plan ahead.\\nIf there is no locating hotline in your areas, you can call the utility companies directly that serve the building and ask them to locate their underground lines.\\n', \"Purchase an approved grounding rod.:  Grounding rods need to made of specific conductive metals and they need to made to a specific length and width. Because of this, it's best to buy a rod that is specifically made for this use. Buying a listed rod, meaning it has been verified by a certification group, will ensure that your grounding rod is the correct size and material. Most home improvement and hardware stores stock approved grounding rods. \\nHigh quality grounding rods are typically made of high carbon steel for it's durability and electro-plated with copper for its conductivity and longevity.\\nIn the US, ground rods need to be at least 8 feet (2.4\\xa0m) long. If they are listed, they need to be at least\\nA listed ground rod will have a marking near the top of it that states that it is approved. The mark allows an electrical inspector to immediately know you have used a proper rod.\\n\", \"Start digging a hole with a shovel or post-hole digger.: digging a hole\\nIf you don't want to dig a hole or you can't for some reason, you will need a ladder or step stool to get up high enough to start pounding in the top of the ground rod.\\n\", 'Drive the rod into the ground.:  Using your hammer, drill, or driving tool, gradually drive the rod vertically into the ground. You need to drive your rod all the way into the ground. The electrical code states that it must have 8 feet (2.4\\xa0m) of contact with the ground, so you need to drive it all the way down.\\nDriving a ground rod into the ground can take a long time and can be difficult work. If you can find someone to take turns driving the rod, it will make for a much easier job.\\nSome electrical inspectors will allow you to leave 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1\\xa0cm) sticking up out of the ground. However, some want the entire thing covered in earth.\\n', \"Pull the grounding electrode conductor to the grounding rod.:  Once the grounding rod has been driven into the ground, you need to connect it to the electrical system of the building. Pull the grounding electrode conductor up to the top of the grounding rod, making sure it is long enough to make a permanent connection between them.\\nGive the grounding electrode a little bit of slack, so it's not extremely tight where it connects with the grounding rod. This will ensure that if it gets hit or pushed on, it won't get dislodged from the grounding rod.\\nIf the grounding electrode conductor has a sheath on it, the last\\n\", 'Clamp the grounding electrode conductor to the grounding rod.:  There are specific clamps that are used to connect grounding electrode conductors to grounding rods. You will need 1 clamp. Put the end of the conductor and the end of the rod inside of the clamp and turn the screw on the clamp to press them together securely.\\nThese clamps are sold in home improvement and hardware stores.\\n', \"Connect the grounding electrode conductor to the ground bus.:  The ground bus is where all the ground and neutral wires are attached in the electrical panel. To make the connection, slide the end of the grounding electrode conductor through one of the holes in the bus and tighten the screw in that hole until it holds the wire very tightly.\\nIn some cases, the ground wires will be connected to the ground bus and the neutral wires are connected to the neutral bus. These 2 bars are then connected with a main bonding jumper. If this is the case, you can attach your grounding electrode conductor wherever it fits on either bus.\\nYou need to be very careful when you are doing any work in an electrical panel. Make sure that your fingers, tools, and the grounding electrode conductor don't make contact with the energized bars in the panel, which are located behind the circuit breakers.\\nIf you are unsure about how to make this connection safely, hire an electrician to do the work.\\n\"], 'ingredients': ['Ground rod', 'Ground rod clamp', 'Grounding electrode conductor', 'Sledge hammer, hammer drill with a ground rod bit, or a manual pile driving tool', 'Shovel or post hole digger', 'Screwdriver', 'Drill', 'Hammer']}","extracted_answer":"install the rod in a location near the electrical panel","question_type":"['navigation']","text_question":"Okay, but what is the very first step of that process?
